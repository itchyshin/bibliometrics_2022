Additionally, it can increase the frequency of chromosomal damage due to exposure to genotoxic agents present in the environment. Among vertebrates, amphibians are the most threatened taxonomic group, especially forest-specialist species. Our work aimed to assess the impact of deforestation on landscape, as well as in the genetic diversity and genomic instability of populations of the amphibian species Crossodactylus schmidti Gallardo, 1961, which is restricted to well-preserved stream environments in the Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil. Sampling of oral mucosa cells was carried out in four different forest areas. We analyzed a total of 200 sequences of two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) and one nuclear gene (Tyrosinase), as well as 1000 oral mucosa cells per individual through cytogenetic analyses. Our results clearly indicate that all forest areas analyzed in this work are important for the genetic diversity and maintenance of these populations in the landscape, regardless of size. However, the largest area has the major role as disperser of genetic diversity, highlighting the importance of conservation units and large forest areas for the persistence of endangered forest-specialist amphibian species. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Crossodactylus schmidti",,

Mining contributes to habitat destruction by the formation of spoil heaps and mine drainage waters. In Stadtschlaining/Burgenland, antimony mining led to increased arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) concentrations in soil and water. This study investigates a contaminated creek, still inhabited by amphibians. (2) Methods: Water and soil were analyzed along the creek and correlated with the occurrence of amphibians. (3) Results: As and Sb were increased, with up to 49,000 mg/kg As and 2446 mg/kg Sb in the soil. Up to 317 mg/kg As and 156 mg/kg Sb became bioavailable under gastric, and up to 298 mg/kg As and 30 mg/kg Sb under intestinal conditions, and were absorbed upon ingestion of soil. Larvae of Salamandra salamandra were found throughout the creek; survival rates were low. Rana temporaria occurs in the most contaminated sections but does not propagate here. Bombina variegata appears occasionally. Amphibians seem not to be able to detect and avoid metal or metalloid contamination.

Modified or anthropogenic waterbodies can be used to compensate for habitat loss, with several amphibian species utilising created or modified waterbodies. We measured usage of anthropogenic/modified waterbodies by adult and tadpole frog species, including threatened species, in coastal wallum habitat in eastern Australia. Nine road trenches/ditches, 8 artificial 'lakes', 6 golf course waterbodies and 13 natural waterbodies were surveyed for frog adults and tadpoles during the summer/spring period 2011-2012. Additionally, we examined the relationship between frog assemblages and environmental factors (water chemistry, aquatic predators, vegetation types), focusing on Litoria olongburensis and Litoria fallax. Frog species richness differed between waterbody types, with two of three threatened frog species present in both natural and anthropogenic/modified waterbodies. The frog assemblage was influenced by pH, turbidity, salinity and percentage cover of certain vegetation types. Measured abundance of L. olongburensis adults and tadpoles were highest in natural waterbodies with high sedge density and low pH. The measured abundance of adult L. fallax was highest within artificial lakes. We conclude that differences in water chemistry and vegetation density can affect the amphibian assemblage within these environments. Therefore, effective conservation of all frog species would be enhanced by conserving a variety of waterbody types. However, natural waterbodies are more likely to be used by threatened species and the conservation of these waterbodies provides the best conservation outcomes. Where habitat offsets may be required, environmental managers should critically assess the quality of constructed habitat for specialist frog species including those associated with acidic, oligotrophic environments. © 2022 Journal Compilation","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Modified Waterbodies | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Litoria fallax,Litoria olongburensis",,

Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban–rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m – 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We investigated the predictive power of random processes to explain species richness and species dissimilarity of amphibian assemblages in a fragmented tropical landscape of the Atlantic Forest of South America. We analyzed a large database of amphibian abundance and occupancy, sampled in 21 forest fragments ranging in size from 1.9 to 619 ha. We compared observed species richness and species dissimilarity with the outcomes of two null (random placement) models: 1- the traditional Coleman's area-based model and 2- an abundance-based model (based on the number of individuals observed in each fragment). We applied these models for all species combined, and separately for forest-dependent and habitat-generalist species. The abundance-based model fitted the observed species richness data better than the area-based model for all species, forest-dependent species, and generalist species. The area-based and the abundance-based models were also able to significantly explain species dissimilarity for all species and for generalists, but not for forest dependent species. The traditional area-based model assigned too many individuals to large fragments, thus failing to accurately explain species richness within patches across the landscape. Although niche-based processes may be important to structuring the regional pool of species in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that part of the variation in species richness and species dissimilarity can be successfully explained by random placement models, especially for generalist species. Evaluating which factors cause variation in the number of individuals among patches should be a focus in future studies aiming to understand biodiversity patterns in fragmented landscapes. © 2022 British Ecological Society","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We found high connectivity among home-range patches within the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve (CCBR) and among those surrounding the CCBR.

Conversely, we detected weak connectivity in the southern and eastern parts of the study area, which is in accordance with the poor habitat quality and fragmentation that characterize that zone. Suitable habitat patches with the largest areas of TDF were the most important in maintaining functional connectivity, but only one patch was within a natural protected area.

Habitat degradation and increased interspecific competition are both concerns for long-term viability of the federally-threatened Cheat Mountain salamander (Plethodon nettingi) which is endemic to high elevations in West Virginia. In this study, we quantified the impacts of linear habitat fragmentation (i.e., a linear forest clearing for creation of a ski slope) on local colonization and extinction probabilities in adjacent forested habitat for the Cheat Mountain salamander and two co-occurring competitor species, eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and Wehrle's salamander (Plethodon wehrlei). We also quantified long-term changes in total occupancy of the species within the high elevation study area. We surveyed the salamander community annually from 1988 to 2021 using diurnal natural cover object searches at 43 plots, with 1988 representing three years following linear habitat fragmentation. For each species, we used dynamic occupancy models to identify and model influential covariates for initial occupancy, colonization, extinction, and detection probability. We found that distance to fragmentation was positively correlated with colonization probability for Cheat Mountain salamanders, indicating negative edge effects of the linear forest clearing. Distance to fragmentation was negatively correlated with colonization probability for eastern red-backed salamanders, potentially indicating this species benefited from increased solar radiation or reduced competition from Cheat Mountain salamanders. Predicted occupancy of eastern red-backed salamanders and Wehrle's salamanders increased over the 34 year monitoring period, indicating potential for increased competitive interactions. Our study suggests that extensive linear habitat fragmentation could result in degraded habitat for Cheat Mountain salamanders in the adjacent forest, and that potential for interactions with competitor species is increasing in high elevation forest stands. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Plethodon wehrlei,Plethodon cinereus,Plethodon nettingi",,

In addition to basic ecological data, the extent of the geographic range has been successfully used as an indicator of species sensitivity to anthropogenic landscapes, with widespread species usually found to be less sensitive compared to range-restricted species. In this study, we investigate connectivity patterns of two closely related but ecologically distinct newt species – the range-restricted, Lissotriton montandoni and the widespread, L. vulgaris – using genomic data, a highly replicated setting (six geographic regions per species), and tools from landscape genetics. Our results show the importance of forest for connectivity in both species, but at the same time suggest differential use of forested habitat, with L. montandoni and L. vulgaris showing the highest connectivity at forest-core and forest-edges, respectively. Anthropogenic landscapes (i.e., higher crop- or urban-cover) increased resistance in both species, but the effect was one to three orders of magnitude stronger in L. montandoni than in L. vulgaris. This result is consistent with a view of L. vulgaris as an ecological generalist. Even so, currently, the negative impact of anthropogenic landscapes is mainly seen in connectivity among L. vulgaris populations, which show significantly stronger isolation and lower effective sizes relative to L. montandoni. Overall, this study emphasizes how habitat destruction is compromising genetic connectivity not only in endemic, range-restricted species of conservation concern but also in widespread generalist species, despite their comparatively lower sensitivity to anthropogenic landscape changes. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Lissotriton vulgaris,Lissotriton montandoni",,

Urban ponds are not typically designed for wildlife but are often colonized by species of conservation concern, including amphibians. Urban ponds may have conservation value, but it is unclear whether they are equally suitable habitat for all amphibians within a local assemblage and which factors most affect habitat quality. Here, we surveyed 96 ponds in the greater Madison, Wisconsin area from four land-use types: 1) golf course ponds, 2) urban park ponds, 3) urban stormwater ponds, and 4) ponds within mixed-use exurban regions. We assessed which local pond characteristics and landscape factors influenced occupancy of amphibian communities using a Bayesian multispecies occupancy model. We detected nine species, finding at least one species at most ponds (91.8%). Ponds within golf courses and urban parks had higher naïve species richness than other urban ponds. We grouped species based on their habitat requirements in their adult stage as (1) upland (for terrestrial adults) and (2) fully aquatic. Occupancy of upland species increased with greater forest cover and pond area, while occupancy of fully aquatic species increased with greater wetland cover, water fluorescence, and lower water turbidity. Our results suggest that species habitat preferences influence the urban ponds they occupy. Urban ponds provide important amphibian habitat for varied species assemblages. Strategic management of urban ponds could therefore provide key ecosystem services, while also facilitating the conservation of amphibians that are increasingly threatened by habitat loss. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

All measured endpoints were negatively impacted in frogs collected from agricultural sites. The largest effect was observed for hatching success (2.77-fold lower) and egg number (2.5-fold lower). Less pronounced effects were observed on male frogs (weight: 1.77-fold lower; SVL: 1.18-fold lower; forelimb width: 1.33-fold lower; nuptial pad length: 1.15-fold lower). Our findings demonstrate negative impacts of agricultural sites on túngara frog health, with the number of viable offspring reduced by almost one third. The methods outlined here are technically simple and low-cost and thereby have potential for application to other species in order to investigate the potential impacts of habitat degradation on amphibian health.

Seven anuran species were considered land use indicators, of which five were considered indicators of grasslands with livestock, and two as indicators of agricultural areas. Generalist species were persistent and dominant in agricultural areas, while habitat specialists disappeared from these areas. Land use was a significant factor explaining the community structure segregation between land uses regardless of the natural variation reported at the local and regional levels.

We also modelled the ecological niche of P. robertsi to assess the most important habitat features associated with its probability of presence and analyzed the corridor network to identify important core areas and corridors to keep the network connected, as well as points where the network connection is lost or tightened. Moreover, we performed a redundancy analysis to assess the effect of genetic distance and habitat resistances on gene flow. We found the highest levels of genetic diversity and connectivity at the northwestern part of the Volcano. Meson Viejo sampling site was of especial importance to overall network connectivity. We found low levels of migration rates and low levels of genetic structure. The most important habitat feature associated with probability of presence of Pseudoeurycea robertsi was the Abies forest, and two models were significant under the RDA analysis: Abies forest and Abies forest+Grasslands.

Reclaimed mines provide an opportunity to create wetlands and restore natural features within a disturbed landscape while benefiting amphibians, a taxa affected by habitat loss. A large-scale restoration effort within the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, USA has resulted in the creation of over 1400 small wetlands. We sampled 39 of these wetlands among four ages (2, 4, 6, and 8 years) to: 1) characterize differences in wetland habitat, 2) estimate amphibian occupancy and abundance, 3) identify wetland characteristics most important for amphibian utilization of wetlands. Mean wetland size, percent canopy cover, percent vegetation cover, distance to the nearest stream, and distance to the nearest forest varied significantly among wetland age classes. Water quality was within normal parameters for natural and created wetlands within our study region. Amphibian occupancy and abundance varied by species, with occupancy predicted by wetland age (Green Frog, Lithobates clamitans) and lower percent vegetation cover (Spotted Salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, L. clamitans) while abundance was predicted by wetland age (A. maculatum), higher percent vegetation cover (Eastern Newt, Notophthalmus viridescens), larger wetland surface area (A. maculatum, N. viridescens), and shorter distance to forest (N. viridescens). Our results indicate, with adequate site preparation, created wetlands on reforested surface mines provide suitable breeding habitat for pond breeding amphibians. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mining,Anura & Caudata | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ambystoma maculatum,Lithobates clamitans,Notophthalmus viridescens",,

In the present study, these two parameters were combined for the in situ assessment of the effects of soybean cultivation on the grassfrog, Leptodactylus fuscus. Specimens were also collected from a protected area to provide a reference site (non-agricultural environment). The frequency of some of the nuclear abnormalities in the animals from the soybean plantation was much higher than that recorded at the reference site, in particular micronuclei, which were 3.6 times more frequent in the plantation, lobulated nuclei (3.4 times more frequent), and reniform nuclei, which were four times more common than at the reference site. The combined analysis of all the ENAs together also revealed a frequency approximately 1.4 times higher in the animals from the soybean plantation, in comparison with the protected area. Smaller areas of hepatic melanin were observed in the specimens from the soybean plantation.

However, the combined effects of different landscape scales on the amphibian declines are poorly understood. We examined the breeding distribution of three frog species, Rana japonica, Rana ornativentris, and Bufo japonicus formosus, along an ecological gradient from urban to mountain areas. The number of egg masses and data on landscape and local variables were collected at 124 sites in Toyota, Okazaki, and Shitara, central Japan. The best model with the lowest value of the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was obtained using landscape variables at a 500-m-radius buffer for all three species. The number of egg masses increased with forest area for all frog species. Yet, other variables differently affected the number of egg masses of three species at each site. The egg-mass number of R. japonica was positively affected by the residential region with much vegetation area & elevation difference, and negatively affected by elevation. That of R. ornativentris was positively influenced by the abandoned paddy-field, and negatively influenced by the total road density. Regarding B. japonicus formosus, its egg-mass number was positively affected by the residential region with much vegetation area, and negatively affected by elevation difference. At the local scale, the water area positively affected the number of egg masses of all three species, while the percentage of concrete revetment has negative effects. This study not only assesses how the assemblage of frogs respond to different habitats at multiple spatial scales along the land use gradient (urban-mountain), but also emphasizes the importance of strategic management actions in agricultural landscapes, allowing the maintenance of habitat diversity for amphibians. © 2021","Cited By :1 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana japonica,Bufo japonicus,Rana ornativentris",,

Despite their wide distribution in the Amazon and Paraná River basins, they had never been recorded along the margins of the more than 340 km of the Paraná River in the provinces of Misiones, Itapúa, and Alto Paraná in Argentina and Paraguay. Comparisons of historical and recent satellite images and analyses of the Paraná River structure indicate that the lake formed after the construction of the Yacyretá Dam (140,000-160,000 ha), which has made novel lentic and semi-lentic environments in the tributary streams identified as large inlets, bays, and lagoons. These transformations favored permanent settlement of aquatic macrophytes, mainly Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and floating ferns (Salvinia sp.), which are the characteristic habitat of L. limellum and B. punctata. Because of these changes, we conducted surveys by boat and from shore to determine whether these frog species colonized the novel environments. We found L. limellum and B. punctata at several localities on the margins of Paraná River within the boundaries of the Yacyretá Lake. Because all observations of both species were at sites with abundant macrophytes, and because neither of them were found in field surveys we conducted before 2011 (i.e., when the Yacyretá Lake filled to maximum capacity), our results support the hypothesis that the new records are related to the artificial wetlands created after the construction of the Yacyretá Dam. © 2021.

It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Understanding the impacts of urban environments on biodiversity is the first step to understanding how to best mitigate biodiversity losses in an increasingly urbanizing world. Analyses with broad geographic and taxonomic coverage can offer critical context for informing urban biodiversity conservation. But such studies are currently lacking, especially for under-studied, but likely highly impacted, taxa such as frogs. Our objective was to document frog diversity in relation to urban environments at continental, regional, and local scales. We used FrogID data, ⁠an opportunistic citizen science dataset generated by volunteers recording calling frogs using a smartphone and validated by experts ⁠throughout continental Australia, to calculate species richness, Shannon diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of frogs in urban and non-urban areas, as well as along a continuous urbanization gradient. The overall species richness of frogs was, on average, 57% less in urban than non-urban areas across six ecoregions. Further, we found significantly lower frog diversity in urban environments compared with non-urban environments across the country, with an average reduction of 59% species richness, 86% Shannon diversity, and 72% phylogenetic diversity. We also found evidence for a steady decrease in frog diversity along an urbanization gradient, with no obvious thresholds.

Breeding ponds and associated populations are threatened by habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation stemming from fire suppression and land conversion. Understanding influences on population dynamics and genetic diversity will help inform recovery efforts for this and other pond-breeding amphibians. We used 9 microsatellite loci to characterize population structure, migration, and genetic diversity of juvenile (larvae and metamorphs) A. bishopi (n = 607) sampled from thirteen breeding ponds across two breeding seasons. Temporal genetic variation between annual cohorts was minimal compared to spatial variation among locations. The primary genetic subdivision was between two regional groups of breeding ponds (i.e. metapopulations), which were located more than 10 km from each other. Yet even within metapopulations, genetic isolation-by-distance was pronounced, and estimated migration rates among ponds separated by > 400 m were very low. Genetic diversity was positively correlated with the area of suitable breeding habitat in a pond and negatively correlated with distance to other occupied ponds. The effective number of breeders typically was < 30 individuals per year per pond, and all populations showed signs of having been through a severe demographic bottleneck. Small and variable local population sizes suggest the importance of metapopulation dynamics among ponds for maintaining regional persistence and genetic diversity. Such dynamics may be easily disrupted for A. bishopi, so maintaining and restoring connectivity appears crucial for long-term conservation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Cited By :2 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ambystoma bishopi",,

We compared samples collected in the early 2000s (sample A) and later on during 2012–2014 (sample B). The terrestrial habitats in the study area were severely reduced and fragmented due to the expansion of the human settlement. We found no significant differences in the age parameters between the two sampling periods; the median lifespan shortened from 3.5 (sample A) to 3.0 years (sample B), while the other age parameters were similar in both samples. In contrast, snout-vent length, body mass and body condition experienced a significant decrease over time. Our results suggest that changes in body size and body condition, rather than age parameters, better reflect the response of the common spadefoot toad population to declining habitat quality.

Sustainable techniques, principally Reduced Impact Logging (RIL), are therefore essential for conserving highly threatened, physiologically sensitive taxa such as amphibians. In this study we compare the effects of CL and RIL on stream amphibians across a regeneration gradient in two forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We analysed data from a community of stream amphibians across 29 transects subject to either CL (18 – 21 years since logging) or RIL (4 – 21). Multi-species occupancy modelling determined community and species responses to logging types, regeneration times and logging associated environmental factors. Diversity profiles, which capture representative diversity indices whilst accounting for community evenness, were calculated using occupancy model results. Our results indicated that several species and community occupancy generally responded negatively to logging associated covariates (lower aboveground carbon density and higher siltation). Stream breeding species occupancy was generally lower in CL compared to RIL sites, with higher generalist breeding species occupancy in CL sites. Diversity profiles identified higher anuran diversity and evenness in RIL compared to CL sites of the same age (18 – 21 years). Furthermore, anuran diversity and evenness exhibited a distinct recovery from 4 to 21 years following RIL. Our results provide strong evidence that RIL reduces the negative impacts on stream habitats, amphibian occupancy and diversity compared to CL, and suggest a far quicker recovery after RIL. We believe RIL presents a promising alternative for sustainable tropical timber management and stream amphibian conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :4 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Logging,Amphibia | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We selected 35 independent stream headwaters along an agricultural expansion and intensification gradient. We conducted anuran call surveys from spring 2012 to summer 2013 and obtained detection-non detection data to estimate mean richness and focal species occupancy. We quantified forest area and riparian forest width at two spatial scales (sub-basin and local reach scale). We measured nutrients and pesticides in water and sediment.

Anuran diversity increased with forest area and riparian forest width, and decreased at sites with herbicide and nutrient contamination, particularly glyphosate; 2,4-D and nitrates. Also, most focal frog species responded mainly to basin forest and 2,4-D. Negative effects of agrochemical contamination on anuran diversity was mitigated in areas with larger basin forest cover. Agricultural management should ensure the reduction of herbicide and fertilizer use, the sparing of adequate forested habitat within drainage areas, and preservation of riparian forests around anuran breeding habitat to reduce and mitigate the negative effects of agrochemical contamination on anurans diversity in agroecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :4 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Trait-based approaches show promise, but traits found to be predictive in one study often fail in others. We seek to understand whether variation in traits’ explanatory power comes about due to interaction effects—between multiple traits and between traits and the environment. We assess the context-dependence of trait-based responses to habitat conversion by testing the hypothesis that abundance in converted habitats decreases with arboreality, while including interactions with reproductive mode, a trait of known importance, and biologically relevant climate variables. Location: Global tropical forest biomes. Time period: 1997–2018. Major taxa studied: Amphibians. Methods: Using 18 studies of amphibian communities from across the globe, we evaluate the role of vertical niche position and reproductive mode in determining abundance within primary forest, structurally complex agriculture, and structurally simple agriculture. We examined interactions between traits, land-use types and climate variables. Results: Average abundance steadily declined from primary forest, through complex agriculture, and was lowest in simple agriculture. Arboreality (high vertical niche position) leads to increased sensitivity to conversion of forest to simple agriculture, while terrestrial species are more sensitive when habitat is converted to complex agriculture. We found no evidence that trait-by-trait interactions determined abundance after habitat conversion. However, the effects of climate can alter how species’ traits determine abundance patterns—while lentic amphibians maintain abundance after conversion regardless of climate zone, direct developers and lotic species become increasingly sensitive to habitat modification in warmer climates. Major conclusions: Vertical niche position acts as a limiting axis in modified environments, with response to conversion dependent on the availability of vegetative strata. Interactions between traits and the environment play a strong and underappreciated role in defining community composition in converted habitats. Such interactions may underlie the difficulties past studies have had in achieving generality across study locations and faunas. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cited By :5 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Over the last decades, sub-populations have become increasingly disconnected and specifically the density of paved roads has increased around the only site connecting northern and southern Seoul populations. We surveyed this locality in Hojobeol, Siheung, Republic of Korea in 2012, 2015 and 2019 to first confirm the decline in the number of sites where D. suweonensis was present. The second objective was to analyze the habitat characteristics and determine the remaining suitable habitat for D. suweonensis through a species distribution model following the maximum entropy method. Our results show that rice paddy cover and distance from the paved road are the most important factor defining suitable habitat for D. suweonensis. At this locality, uninterrupted rice paddies are a suitable habitat for the species when reaching at least 0.19 km2, with an average distance of 138 ± 93 m2 from the roads. We link the decrease in the number of sites where D. suweonensis is present with the decrease in rice paddy cover, generally replaced by localized infrastructures, greenhouses and habitat fragmentation. Rice paddies should remain connected over a large area for the protection of the remaining populations.

At the continental scale, we included data from regions in the northern distribution with fragmented populations (Hesse and Lower Saxony, Germany) and more continuous populations in the South (Alsace, France; Geneva, Switzerland; Trentino, Italy) to evaluate variation of genetic diversity. At the local scale, short-term fragmentation caused significant genetic differentiation between breeding assemblages only 1.4 km apart from each other. At the regional scale, we found notable genetic distance among localities. At the continental scale, we identified Alsace, Trentino and Geneva in the South as regions with low genetic structuring and high allelic richness, and the northern remaining regions in Germany as deeply structured with reduced allelic richness. We suggest that reduced genetic diversity and habitat fragmentation in northern regions makes these populations particularly vulnerable to decline. In conclusion, informed conservation management of B. variegata should focus on measures maintaining or improving connectivity among neighbouring populations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cited By :2 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Bombina variegata",,

Our aim was to investigate how urbanization shapes species richness (SR) and composition of anuran communities in NW Argentina, and to determine which suite of life history traits are related to anuran tolerance to urban development. We classified anuran species in Functional Groups (FG) based on a series of ecological traits and recognized them as urban-tolerant or urban-avoiders. We constructed an urbanization composite index (UI) through an exploratory factor analysis based on measures of artificial light intensity, noise pollution, land use types, and mean values of LTS, NDMI, and NDVI. We tested the response of SR, FG and species occurrence to UI with Generalized Linear Models and a variation partitioning analysis. Our results showed the negative influence of urbanization on anuran diversity and suggested that the loss of anuran species is not random, pointing to the presence of environmental filters. Only terrestrial frogs that build aquatic foam nests were not affected by an increase in urbanization, so they may be considered as urban--tolerant. Further, our results highlighted the important role of dispersal capacity in structuring the urban anuran assemblages. As ecologists working in urban habitats, we emphasize the need of a more comprehensive and generalized understanding of ecological and life history traits associated with urban tolerant anurans. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cited By :1 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

The endangered farmland green treefrog (Zhangixalus arvalis) primarily inhabits woodlands of agricultural landscapes in central Taiwan. Recently, due to increased demands for pineapple products, many woodlands, particularly bamboo plantations, were converted to pineapple fields. This study aimed to quantify the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on Z. arvalis due to changes in land cover in an agricultural landscape. The study area contained 34,243 50 m × 50 m grids. In 2006 and 2014–2015, we used acoustic surveys to survey the occurrence of Z. arvalis in each grid. We obtained satellite images of the study area for 2006 and 2014, and we assigned the land-cover type of each grid to one of the following six types: woodland, brushland, cropland, bareland, manmade structures and water body. We examined whether Z. arvalis preferred a certain land-cover type by comparing the proportion of cover types available and the proportion of cover types used by the frogs. Furthermore, we used occurrence records for 2006 and 2014–2015 and applied the Maximum Entropy Model to predict suitable habitat for the respective years. We mapped the loss of suitable habitat and used six indices to quantify habitat fragmentation within the 8 years. We also tested the prediction that the occupancy rate of Z. arvalis in different-sized habitat patches was a function of patch size. Zhangixalus arvalis exhibited a strong preference for woodland, but avoided cropland and manmade structures. From 2006 to 2014–2015, the suitable habitat decreased 4.1%, and all six indices showed an increase in habitat fragmentation. The occupancy rate of different-sized woodland patches was positively correlated with patch size. Mapping suitable habitat and identifying the potential gaps in functional habitat connectivity can be used to guide effective measures for conserving Z. arvalis. © 2021 Academia Sinica, Taiwan.","Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Zhangixalus arvalis",,

Amphibians have experienced worldwide population declines, with habitat loss acting as one of the most disruptive causes. How amphibian species response to changing habitats could be reflected in their utilization and assimilation of resources. Using stable isotopes, we explored trophic niche variation between natural and transformed habitats for three closely related frog species in the genus Feirana (F. quadranus, F. taihangnica and F. kangxianensis). Our results indicated that the δ13C value was negatively correlated with body size (snout-vent length) and the δ15N value increased along with the ontogenetic process. The δ13C values were significantly different among habitat types, and the variation of δ15N values was relatively limited in different disturbed gradients. Urban groups displayed broader trophic niche width than both rural and natural groups. When species in sympatry, their resource utilization and trophic niche overlap probability were more similar in rural habitats than their natural counterparts. Our findings would be conducive to understand trophic niche and function variation in amphibians during the urbanization process, allowing for effective predictions of ecological consequences of habitat transformation.

Additionally, the realization of the multidimensionality of biodiversity demands studies integrating variation of functional traits and phylogenetic information as complements to address the effects of land use on the structure of animal communities. Herein, we investigated the effects of land use (i.e., intensive agricultural and extensive livestock rearing) on functional and phylogenetic diversity of anuran communities in farmland ponds from the Uruguayan savanna ecoregion, while considering the effects of local factors (i.e., water depth) on species composition. We surveyed adults and tadpoles in 22 ponds and quantified five traits related to tadpole feeding, habitat use, and predator avoidance. Tadpole identification was corroborated by DNA barcoding based on a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. We observed a decline in phylogenetic mean nearest taxon distance associated with increase of surrounding agricultural land use. While land use intensification did not affect richness (functional or phylogenetic), ponds in livestock ranches hosted about four times more tadpoles than agricultural ponds. Functional evenness decreased with water depth, although such relationship disappeared when considering phylogenetic non-independence. Our results indicated that specific anuran clades were more sensitive to intensification in land use, reinforcing a recent view of phylogenetic homogenization following habitat conversion. Additionally, our study suggests that extensive cattle grazing over wide native pastures may provide an alternative more compatible with conservation than short-term crops in subtropical grasslands.

As this species is protected through the Bern Convention, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of its habitat requirements to ensure proper conservation measures. We trained, validated and optimized classification tree models based on data on local aquatic habitat conditions from 125 farmland ponds scattered over Belgium and Luxembourg where the alpine newt commonly occurs. To obtain user-friendly and representative models, data was pre-processed and stratified after which different degrees of pruning were applied for model optimization. In order to check the model's applicability for management, we predicted alpine newt occurrence with an independent dataset. The most robust and reliable model revealed that fish absence was the major driving factor followed by the thickness of the sludge layer. We found that fish presence established alpine newt absence and that fishless ponds with a sludge layer of 15 cm or more were predicted to host no alpine newts. The latter provides quantitative information for decision makers. Moreover, our results indicated that the amount of sludge could be associated with eutrophication and erosion. Regarding management practices, it is advised to assure the absence of fish and reduce sludge accumulation in ponds designated for the conservation of alpine newts, for example by designing temporary ponds not fed through fish-containing surface waters. Furthermore, we recommend to install buffer strips around a pond to reduce nutrient and soil run-off from the terrestrial environment. © 2020 The Authors","Cited By :4 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ichthyosaura alpestris",,

These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cited By :5 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Plethodon cinereus",,

Anuran larvae can be highly diverse, can reach high biomass and can play important roles in tropical streams; yet, compared to the adult frog communities, relatively little is known about how larval communities respond to disturbance. Information on larvae is highly relevant for amphibian conservation because larvae represent direct evidence of breeding and thus provide a good indicator of species persistence in disturbed habitats. We studied tadpole assemblages in Ranomafana, southeastern part of Madagascar, in streams in a disturbed forest (previously logged forest), at “forest edge” (streams embedded in matrix nearby forest blocks), and compared these to communities in a primary forest. We sampled tadpoles at the microhabitat level (“pools” and “riffles”) in 9 streams. We recorded 27 species with a maximum of 17 species/stream recorded at edge. The three habitats harbored different assemblages, but, as could be expected, more similarities existed among forest habitats than between forest and non-forest habitats. The most and the least diverse communities were recorded at edge and in the disturbed forest, respectively. Assemblages were dominated by one generalist species, and changes in communities were mostly driven by changes in forest specialists, which either decreased in disturbed forest or were replaced by edge specialists outside forest. Although species richness varied, relative abundances were maintained among habitats, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in tadpole biomass. Community structure changed at the microhabitat level: pool environments usually harbored relatively higher species richness and abundance than riffles. Our study highlights the relevance of edge habitats for maintaining amphibian diversity and the pronounced negative effects of past logging activities on tadpole communities. Given the diverse roles of tadpoles in streams, changes in community structure potentially affect critical stream ecosystem processes.

Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the accessible habitat for this species and identify key elements to maintain its ecological network in two different types of land uses: an anthropized area with extensive cattle raising and a protected area. Methods: The structural and functional characteristics of both landscapes were analyzed. The connectivity at landscape level and the contribution of each habitat patch were evaluated through simulation models with different dispersion distances in the context of the graph theory. Results: In both landscapes, nine types of landcover were identified with different compositions. Remarkable differences were found in habitat connectivity for this amphibian species between both landscapes. As the percentage of dispersion distance increases, reachable habitat increases as well, although with higher percentages in the protected area. Two corridors were identified in the protected landscape and one in the rangeland one; patches and key links constituted all of them.

The formation of temporary ponds was negatively influenced by the increase of shrub cover in the vicinity of ponds. The loss of temporary ponds had significant negative influence on the amphibian species assemblages in the remaining temporary ponds. The social component of the research highlights a social-ecological feedback consisting of village depopulation, incorrect interpretation of nature protection law by officials, shrub encroachment caused by the abandonment of grazing and the loss of local's motivations to restart traditional grazing due to the excessive shrub encroachment.

Smaller amphibian populations may lose more genetic diversity, and become more dependent on immigration for survival. Investigations of landscape factors and patterns mediating migration and population genetic differentiation are fundamental for knowledge-based conservation. The pond-breeding northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) populations are decreasing throughout Europe, and are a conservation concern. Using microsatellites, we studied the genetic structure of the northern crested newt in a boreal forest ecosystem containing two contrasting landscapes, one subject to recent change and habitat loss by clear-cutting and roadbuilding, and one with little anthropogenic disturbance. Newts from 12 breeding ponds were analyzed for 13 microsatellites and 7 landscape and spatial variables. With a Maximum-likelihood population-effects model we investigated important landscape factors potentially explaining genetic patterns. Results indicate that intervening landscape factors between breeding ponds, explain the genetic differentiation in addition to an isolation-by-distance effect. Geographic distance, gravel roads, and south/south-west facing slopes reduced landscape permeability and increased genetic differentiation for these newts. The effect was opposite for streams, presumably being more favorable for newt dispersal. Populations within or bordering on old growth forest had a higher allelic richness than populations in managed forest outside these areas.

We evaluated effects of habitat transformation and seasonality on anuran-prey food webs in Colombian dry-forests. We asked whether anthropic transformation (anthropic vs natural) and/or seasonality (dry, minor and major rain seasons) affect predator load on arthropods, the occurrence of energetic bottlenecks, and the diet overlap of anurans. We selected six dry forest sites in the Caribbean of Colombia, sampled anurans, and identified their stomach contents to construct anuran-prey food webs. We show that the global structure of food webs was affected by disturbance and seasonality, but not by their interaction. Prey vulnerability was higher in anthropic habitats. Habitat transformation enhanced diet overlap among predators, but there was not a differential effect of habitat type according to seasonality for network metrics. Our study shows a strong effect of natural vegetation modification in tropical dry forest on anuran-prey food webs, while seasonality did not seem to further mediate these effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cited By :2 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Here, we characterized the richness, abundance, taxonomic composition, prevalence and intensity of helminth infection in four anuran species. Host anurans were collected in 34 ponds (19 in native grasslands with livestock and 15 in agricultural cultivation) from the highland grasslands in the Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Paraná. Our results showed a significant difference between native grasslands with livestock and agricultural cultivation regarding the structure of helminth communities for the hosts Aplastodiscus perviridis and Pseudis cardosoi. We also found a greater prevalence and intensity of infection in anurans in areas of agricultural cultivation than in native grasslands with livestock. We found that the environmental descriptors (local and landscape) seem to explain most of the differences in anuran parasitism recorded between native grasslands with livestock and agricultural areas. Thus, we emphasized that the loss of grassy habitat due to conversion to agricultural cultivation can alter helminth communities in anurans, with further work needed to understand the mechanisms involved.

Pandi's mushroom-tongue salamander (Bolitoglossa pandi) is one of the threatened amphibians in South America, as well as a flagship species for the Colombian conservation agenda. This species is endemic to the Andean cloud forests of the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, occurring only in the department of Cundinamarca within a narrow elevational range. At night, B. pandi can be seen perching on the upper side of leaves at heights ranging from ground level to 2.5 m. During the day, it can be found under leaf litter or cover objects. Few studies have provided relevant information that can help the Colombian government to formulate lines of action for the conservation of this species; consequently, its threat assessments so far have been based on very limited information. Methods. We conducted surveys for salamanders in four municipalities of Cundinamarca, Colombia, using two approaches: visual encounter surveys (Guaduas and Villeta) and the basic sampling protocol for single-species occupancy modeling (Supatá and Venecia). Multivariate analyses were employed to explore the correlation between habitat structure and natural history traits, abundance, and detection/non-detection of B. pandi. We evaluated the B. pandi activity pattern through kernel density curves for each sampling occasion and explored the variability of salamander abundance during their activity period by performing a nested ANOVA. Results. We report the discovery of two new populations of B. pandi, which represent the most northwestern records known. A significant correlation between body length, body mass, and habitat structure was observed. Multivariate analyses indicated that leaf litter depth, mean temperature, percent vegetation cover, and altitude were the habitat variables that together explained 60.3% of the B. pandi abundance variability, as well as the main determinants of its optimal habitat. Bolitoglossa pandi exhibits an activity pattern characterized by two main activity peaks, in which niche time-partitioning was observed. Across the surveyed area, we found a healthy, stable, highly dense population of B. pandi (&gt;1,300 individuals), with seasonal variability between development stages. Discussion. Given the high habitat specificity of B. pandi, the species is highly vulnerable to local changes. Thus, we recommend that B. pandi be retained as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List, based on the IUCN Criterion B, given its restricted extent of occurrence (ca. 2,500 km2) and the ongoing threats from agriculture, cattle ranching, logging, and urban development, which continue to reduce its suitable habitat.

In these threatened landscapes, there are many organisms that acquire chemical defenses from their diet and are therefore intimately connected with their local food webs. Poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) are one such example, as they acquire alkaloid-based chemical defenses from their diet of leaf litter ants and mites. It is currently unknown how habitat fragmentation impacts chemical defense across trophic levels, from arthropods to frogs. We examined the chemical defenses and diet of the Diablito poison frog (Oophaga sylvatica), and the diversity of their leaf litter ant communities in secondary forest and reclaimed cattle pasture. Notably, this research was performed in collaboration with two high school science classrooms. We found that the leaf litter of forest and pasture frog habitats differed significantly in ant community structure. We also found that forest and pasture frogs differed significantly in diet and alkaloid profiles, where forest frogs contained more of specific alkaloids and ate more ants in both number and volume. Finally, ant species composition of frog diets resembled the surrounding leaf litter, but diets were less variable. This suggests that frogs tend to consume particular ant species within each habitat. To better understand how ants contribute to the alkaloid chemical profiles of frogs, we chemically profiled several ant species and found some alkaloids to be common across many ant species while others are restricted to a few species. At least one alkaloid (223H) found in ants from disturbed sites was also found in skins from pasture frogs. Our experiments are the first to link anthropogenic land use changes to dendrobatid poison frog chemical defenses through variation in leaf litter communities, which has implications for conservation management of these threatened amphibians. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

We investigated the diet of a forest-dwelling frog species, Morafka's frog (Odorrana morafkai), in a highland forest in Vietnam in relation to habitat disturbance, sex and season. We surveyed the species at 45 sites in forest of varying disturbance and examined its diet using stomach flushing, estimating prey availability via trapping. We detected significantly fewer O. morafkai in highly disturbed habitats compared to moderately disturbed or non-disturbed habitats. We revealed that O. morafkai is a dietary generalist, identifying 28 prey types, primarily invertebrates. Prey composition, the number of prey items per stomach and prey volume per stomach did not vary between disturbance levels. Diet did not vary significantly between sexes, except that females had a higher prey volume. Prey composition in the species varied between seasons, with Coleoptera and Orthoptera dominating the diet in the rainy season and Lepidoptera in the dry season. The number of prey items per stomach and prey volume were significantly higher in the rainy season. There was a significant correlation between prey availability and diet composition. The low number of O. morafkai detected in highly disturbed habitats suggests that this habitat may not be optimal for the species, despite having a generalist feeding strategy and presumed high mobility.

We used single season occupancy models to compare the occurrence of larvae of four species of pond-breeding amphibians in wetlands created for mitigation, wetlands impacted by road construction, and unimpacted reference wetlands along a highway corridor in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, United States. Created wetlands were shallow and had less aquatic vegetation and surface area than impacted and reference wetlands. Occupancy of barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium) and boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) larvae was similar across wetland types, whereas boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas) occurred more often in created wetlands than reference and impacted wetlands. However, the majority of created wetlands (>80%) dried partially or completely before amphibian metamorphosis occurred in both years of our study, resulting in heavy mortality of larvae and, we suspect, little to no recruitment. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), which require emergent vegetation that is not common in newly created wetlands, occurred commonly in impacted and reference wetlands but were found in only one created wetland.

However, disturbances may have impacts beyond the species level, if the species lost represent unique functions in the ecosystem. In this study, we evaluated to what extent the amount of habitat can determine the functional diversity and nestedness of amphibian communities in an Atlantic Forest fragmented landscape in Brazil, and if there is a threshold of habitat amount beyond which there is severe loss of functional diversity. As species responses may depend on their habitat type, we performed the analyses for three different sets of species: all species, forest-dependent species, and generalist species. We also evaluated the relative importance of turnover and nestedness components to total functional dissimilarity among sites. Habitat amount affected functional diversity of frogs, especially for forest-dependent species where a linear reduction was detected. The functional dissimilarity among sites was mostly explained by the nestedness component. The reduction of functional diversity was mediated by an ordered loss of traits, leading to a functionally nested metacommunity. These sensitive traits were closely related to habits and reproductive modes that depend on rivers and streams. The maintenance of functional diversity of frogs in fragmented landscapes must rely on the conservation of both terrestrial and aquatic environments, as some species and their traits can disappear from remnants of native vegetation lacking some specific habitats (e.g. streams).

Among the 408 Chinese amphibians, 174 species are considered threatened according to the China Biodiversity Red List in 2015. However, to date, which species traits or extrinsic factors are correlated with extinction risk in Chinese amphibians is rarely examined. The aims of this study were thus to identify the patterns and correlates of extinction risk in Chinese amphibians and to determine whether patterns and processes are similar between species with either small or large geographic distributions. Location: China. Methods: We obtained twelve species traits and four extrinsic factors that have been commonly linked to the extinction risk of amphibians. After phylogenetic correction, these factors were tested separately and in combination to identify their correlations with extinction risk in all Chinese amphibians, and in small-ranged and large-ranged species. Results: Geographic range size and elevational range were the most important predictors of extinction risk in all Chinese amphibians. Although extinction risk in small-ranged amphibians was predominantly determined by small elevational range, in large-ranged amphibians it was driven by geographic and elevational ranges, body size, human exploitation index and adult microhabitat. Small-ranged amphibians had a higher percentage of threatened species than large-ranged species. However, the body size distributions were not statistically different between these two amphibian subgroups. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that conservation priority should be given to species with small geographic and elevational ranges. Small-ranged and large-ranged amphibians should be conserved with different strategies because the factors influencing extinction risk differ between these two groups. In specific, the reduction of habitat loss should be a primary focus of management efforts because species with small geographic and elevational ranges are particually vulnerable to habitat loss. Conservation efforts should also focus on protecting large-bodied species and preventing human overexploitation for the effective conservation of large-ranged amphibians. © 2019 The Authors.

We aimed to identify which land management types and environmental factors influenced the use of grazing landscapes by frogs. We surveyed frog assemblages in remnant vegetation, four different paddock types (pasture, linear planting, coarse woody debris addition and fence), and two grazing regimes (continuous and rotational). Frogs were surveyed using pitfall and funnel traps in twelve grazing farms in south-eastern Australia. We found that grazed agricultural landscapes provide important habitats for a variety of species of frogs and that frog assemblages were influenced by both farm management type and environmental variables, and their interactions. Total frog abundance increased with proximity to water more strongly in remnants compared to paddocks. This difference in response may be due to different traits and behaviours of frogs in remnants compared to frogs in open paddocks. Rare frog species richness and abundance of a common species (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) increased with taller ground cover in remnants but no such relationship occurred in paddocks. Different types of predation risk in remnants compared to paddocks may result in greater ground cover shelter requirements in remnants, as vegetation structure can strongly influence predation. Total frog species richness increased more rapidly with higher rainfall in continuously grazed versus rotationally grazed farms. Higher rainfall was associated with taller ground cover. Continuously grazed farms had shorter average ground cover than rotationally grazed farms and the increased ground cover height associated with more rain may bring ground cover to a height better able to provide shelter and reduce desiccation risk for frogs. Our study highlights the importance of both land management practices and environmental conditions and their interaction in shaping frog assemblages. Improved frog biodiversity conservation may be achieved in grazing landscapes by retaining patches of remnant vegetation, maintaining water bodies such as farm dams, and maintaining tall ground cover within vegetation remnants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :7 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Twelve sites along three rivers were characterized in regard to urbanization and habitat condition using the calculation of a Habitat Model Affinity (HMA) score. Fifteen water quality parameters were assessed at each site. A Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) and a general Water Quality Index (WQI) were applied. Species richness and relative abundance of amphibians were estimated from visual encounter and calling surveys during summer season between 2009 and 2013. Species richness and abundance were negatively correlated with phosphate, nitrate concentrations and total coliforms, and positively correlated with HMA, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen. Species richness was also affected negatively by turbidity. Principal component analysis showed that sites with higher amphibian community metrics were also the ones with lower nutrient levels and better habitat conditions.

To mitigate these impacts, conservation managers may protect core habitats and pursue habitat creation or enhancement actions, including construction of artificial wetlands, manipulation of wetland hydroperiods, removal of invasive species or restoration of aquatic and riparian vegetation. Yet management budgets are universally tight. When planning such actions, managers face the fundamental and complex problem of choosing where and when to invest limited resources to maximize the likelihood of species persistence. Here, we extend our previous research on this problem, and demonstrate the utility of coupling occupancy models with optimization algorithms to identify preferred habitat management schemes across multiple, disjunct habitat networks. Our real-world case study, completed in close collaboration with conservation managers, focussed on optimal habitat creation schemes for a threatened Australian frog in a rapidly urbanizing region. Our new technique identified clear priorities for investment in wetland construction both among and within seven disjunct habitat networks, solving a spatial prioritization problem that entailed millions of potential solutions and which was otherwise intractable. Such complex, multi-scale spatial prioritization problems are pervasive in amphibian conservation. Coupling occupancy models with spatial optimization algorithms represents a promising avenue to solve these problems and design habitat protection, creation and management schemes that maximize the chance of species persistence. © 2019","Cited By :11 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Habitat augmentation (e.g., wetland creation) is a growing conservation strategy to stem population declines in regions affected by habitat loss, but such actions are often implemented indiscriminately of landscape contexts that may mediate conservation outcomes for species with complex life cycles (i.e., distinct larval, juvenile, and adult stages). We examined the contribution of variation in quantity of larval (aquatic) and quality of juvenile/adult (terrestrial) habitat to the distribution of two pool-breeding and forest-dependent amphibian species in upland forest patches with histories that ranged from former agricultural lands (secondary forests) to never having been deforested (legacy forests). Using area-constrained visual encounter surveys in two consecutive years with contrasting precipitation conditions (extreme drought and extreme rainfall), we estimated forest patch occupancy probabilities of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) at a study area in central New York State, USA, and characterized terrestrial microhabitats in 29 population “neighborhoods” (9.3 ha) that varied in larval habitat availability (0–10 constructed vernal pools) and extent of secondary versus legacy forest. Terrestrial amphibian habitat in secondary forests featured shallower leaf litter, denser understory vegetation, and fewer cover object refuges than in legacy forests. The presence of wood frogs was solely affected by breeding pool densities whereas that of the longer-lived and less dispersive spotted salamanders depended on both quantity of larval habitat and quality of terrestrial habitat, with higher levels of occurrence in legacy forests and, during the drought year, where pool densities were greater. These results suggest that larval habitat augmentation can boost populations of amphibians with complex life cycles, but climate variation and land-use legacies mediate conservation outcomes for long-lived habitat specialists. © 2019 The Authors","Cited By :5 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Agriculture,Anura & Caudata | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ambystoma maculatum,Lithobates sylvaticus",,

We applied graph-theoretic network analyses to a set of 35 waterbodies embedded in 10 rice fields in a savanna-rain forest ecotone, Tocantins, Brazil, to assess the importance of landscape features (forest patches, waterbodies) for anuran functional connectivity within the entire network. We used taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity as proxies of anuran functional connectivity (i.e. dispersal ability intrinsic to the taxa), based on previous associations uncovered between species diversity metrics and landscape connectivity. We found that, assuming individuals belonging to each of the 14 amphibian species recorded are unable to disperse over 800 m, forest and waterbody area and abundance are the most important predictors of waterbody importance for connectivity. Hence, pond network connectivity for amphibians in rice crops depends on (1) abundant and large forest patches in the area surrounding waterbodies, and (2) a network of abundant waterbodies. © Cambridge University Press 2019.","Cited By :5 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We determined the composition and abundance of the anurofauna in urban and rural sites within the municipality of Itacoatiara in central Amazonia, Brazil.

A total of 1,538 anurans (930 in rural sites and 608 in urban sites) were recorded, belonging to 29 species in five families. Species richness was higher in rural sites, with 10 exclusive species. All species found in urban sites were also found in rural sites, however, species abundance varied considerably between the habitats. Sampling-and individual-based rarefaction curves showed a tendency toward stabilization of species richness only in the urban sites. We concluded that the anuran assemblages in the urban sites are depauperate due to the absence of many species associated to pristine terra firme or várzea and igapó forests. Habitat loss and quality degradation in urban landscapes are the main factors threatening amphibian diversity. The anuran assemblages in our study areas were similar to those recorded in other Amazonian habitats.

The remaining forest patches were found to be significant habitat for several species endemic to the mountains of Cameroon-Nigeria. The savanna, likely expanded by livestock grazing, held numerous reed frog species that likely benefit from forest loss, especially in low-to mid-range elevations.

The study was conducted in the northwest part of the state of Hidalgo, in a transition zone between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Gulf of Mexico, which is a region rich in amphibian species. The results indicate that alpha diversity decreases with loss of canopy cover, this being high in mountain cloud forest, tropical evergreen forest, and Shade coffee, and low in milpa huasteca and grazing areas.

Mountain cloud forest contains both exclusive species and the highest number of species currently regarded as threatened by national and international conservation assessment systems. In order to preserve amphibian diversity in the study area it is vital to protect the last remnants of native vegetation, especially mountain cloud forest, but also including Shade coffee, since the latter habitat harbors amphibian diversity similar to that found in native forests. Finally, implementation of policies that both reduce Grazing areas and increase their productivity is also necessary, since these highly modified areas turn out to be the ones that affect amphibian diversity the most. © 2019 Lara-Tufi o et al.","Cited By :5 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

These heterogeneous landscapes are particularly favorable for biodiversity but their role for amphibian conservation remain understudied. We studied the amphibian community (15 species) of a hedgerow network landscape in western France. We described 79 cattle ponds and tested the influence of ponds characteristics as well as the surrounding landscape composition on species occurrence. Amphibian diversity was positively influenced by breeding site vegetation and also ponds density in the surrounding landscape. We also found positive effects of wood patches and hedgerow linear at a small spatial scale. In turn, crop cover and road linear negatively influences amphibian richness at a large spatial scales.

Effects of land cover change on species can be direct (when habitat is converted to alternative land cover types) or indirect (when land outside of the species habitat is altered). Hydrologic and ecological connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems are well understood, exemplifying how spatially disparate land cover conditions may influence aquatic habitats, but are rarely examined. We sought to quantify relative effects of land cover at two different but interacting scales on habitat suitability for the endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus). Based on an existing distribution model for the arroyo toad and available land cover data, we estimated effects of land cover along streams and within entire watersheds on habitat suitability using structural equation modeling. Relationships between land cover and habitat suitability differed between scales, and broader, watershed-scale conditions influenced land cover along the embedded stream networks. We found anthropogenic development and forest cover at the watershed-scale negatively impacted habitat suitability, but development along stream networks was positively associated with suitability. The positive association between development along streams and habitat suitability may be attributable to increased spatial heterogeneity along urbanized streams, or related factors including policies designed to conserve riparian habitats amidst development. These findings show arroyo toad habitat is influenced by land cover across multiple scales, and can inform conservation of the species.

Identifying how populations are affected by landscape barriers such as roads is essential for conservation and requires understanding the processes underpinning species occupancy in fragmented landscapes. Here, I assessed relationships between the occupancy dynamics of the threatened green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) and accessible habitat; i.e., the area of breeding and non-breeding habitat around a wetland that can be reached by an amphibian without having to cross a highway. I hypothesised that relationships between occupancy and accessible habitat would be stronger than relationships with the area of extant native vegetation, road density or distance to the highway. I also examined relationships with local habitat variables over a three-year period. Relationships with accessible habitat were stronger and more certain in explaining L. aurea occupancy and colonisation than other landscape variables. Accessible habitat was positively associated with wetland occupancy, which suggests the highway is having a barrier effect on the population. There was a positive relationship between road density and the probability of local extinction. Occupancy rates at highway compensatory ponds increased from near-zero within six months of pond construction, to >30% after 12 months. There was a negative relationship between local extinction and aquatic vegetation cover, highlighting the importance of habitat structure for L. aurea.

The aim of this study was to assess and compare anuran assemblages under different land-uses in a subtropical forest of NW Argentina using an integrative view of diversity through different measures. We assessed alpha and beta diversity components for three complementary diversity measures: species richness, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity in three land-uses: forest, tobacco and suburban. We carried out generalized linear mixed models with an autocorrelation structure to compare the three diversity measures across the different land-uses. We also used a beta diversity partitioning method to determine nestedness and turnover processes in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarity.

However, there are few empirical examples of how increased population density experienced by larval stages produces long-term effects on growth and fitness at postmetamorphic stages. We tested the effect of four different larval densities on the demography and growth of the endangered stream-dwelling newt Euproctus platycephalus. By manipulating larval populations in experimental aquaria, we analyzed the short-term effects of density in terms of growth and mortality rates as well as of social behavior. To assess medium- and long-term effects we tested the metamorph individuals after 1 and 3 years, respectively, and adults for maternal effect by assessing the relationship between mean larval size and fecundity. Larval body size and growth rate appeared inversely proportional to larval density. Density affected the incidence of aggressive behavior by increasing the rate of mutilation to arms and tail. One-year-old salamanders raised at the highest larval density grew significantly less. All 3-year-old individuals reached comparable body size and body condition irrespective of initial larval density. Salamanders presented a positive relationship between maternal size and (1) fecundity and (2) larval size. In natural conditions, increased density may cause slower growth and a reduction in the percentage of individuals reaching metamorphosis.

The composition of the surrounding matrix, structure of stream networks, and topography are also important landscape characteristics influencing amphibian distributions. Tropical forests have high diversity and endemism of amphibians, but little is known about the specific responses of many of these species to landscape features. In this paper, we quantify the response of amphibian species and communities to landscape-scale characteristics in streams within the fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We surveyed amphibian communities during a rainy season in 50 independent stream segments using Standardized Acoustic and Visual Transect Sampling (active) and Automated Acoustic Recorders (passive) methods. We developed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to quantify the influence of landscape-scale characteristics (forest cover, agriculture, catchment area, stream density, and slope) on amphibian occurrence probabilities while accounting for imperfect detection of species using the two survey methods. At the community level, we estimated an overall mean positive relationship between amphibian occurrence probabilities and forest cover, and a negative relationship with agriculture. Catchment area and slope were negatively related with amphibian community structure (95% credible interval [CI] did not overlap zero). The species-level relationships with landscape covariates were highly variable but showed similar patterns to those at the community level. Species detection probabilities varied widely and were influenced by the sampling method. For most species, the active method resulted in higher detection probabilities than the passive approach. Our findings suggest that small streams and flat topography lead to higher amphibian occurrence probabilities for many species in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. Our results combined with land use and topographic maps can be used to make predictions of amphibian occurrences and distributions beyond our study area.

However, the legislation in many Western European countries requires the rehabilitation of “damaged” areas following logging and mining operations, which can eliminate these early successional habitats. Conservation managers face a dilemma in these situations, but often lack knowledge about the impacts of environmental rehabilitation on the population dynamics of pioneer species and so are unable to take this into account in their actions. We investigated the demography of a spatially structured population of an endangered amphibian (Bombina variegata) that uses waterbodies created by logging activities as breeding sites. Using capture–recapture (CR) data collected during a 9-year study period, we examined how the destruction of breeding patches due to environmental rehabilitation affected adult survival and the long-term population growth rate. For this purpose, we used recently developed capture–recapture multievent models to estimate survival and dispersal rates in the spatially structured population. We then used these estimates to simulate population trajectories and viability depending on differing frequency of breeding patch destruction. The multievent models revealed that dispersal not resulting from patch loss was relatively high and was sex biased. They also highlighted that patch destruction had a negative impact on adult survival. Moreover, simulations showed that the increase in patch destruction frequency had a strong negative influence on the population growth rate, even when the number of patches remained constant over time. This impact was intensified if female fecundity was also affected. Synthesis and applications. Our study quantifies for the first time the detrimental effect of habitat rehabilitation on the population dynamics of an endangered, pioneer species. Our results show that this deleterious impact of patch destruction could be reduced by certain management practices, such as avoiding the systematic rehabilitation of the breeding patches and compensating for patch destruction by creating substitute breeding patches. © 2018 The Authors.

We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) to assess the population genetic structure of two poorly known species, Cardioglossa schioetzi and Leptodactylodon bicolor (both in the Arthroleptidae), in and around Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve on the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria. The landscape comprises continuous forest on steep slopes and small riparian forest fragments in a grassland matrix. While increased fragmentation is well documented for these and other forests in the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria over the past century, there are no previous assessments of the impact of forest fragmentation on montane amphibian populations in this region. Our estimates of genetic diversity are similar across populations within each species with levels of heterozygosity values consistent with local population declines. Except for a pair of populations (C. schioetzi) we did not observe genetic differentiation between forest and riparian forest fragment populations, nor across sites within continuous forest (L. bicolor). Our results demonstrate recent gene flow between forest fragments and the adjacent protected forests and suggest that small forest corridors connecting these may lessen the genetic consequences of at least 30 years of intense and severe fragmentation in Ngel Nyaki.

For the analyses, 21 breeding sites were classified into three categories: open area (OA; n=7), forest interior (FI; n=7) and forest edge (FE; n=7). A diversity profile analysis was performed to evaluate alpha diversity. ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses were carried out to verify differences regarding species composition (beta diversity) between the categories. A total of 33 species comprising nine families were recorded, representing ca. 80% of the estimated richness for the region. The greatest alpha diversity was observed in FI, whereas OA and FE did not differ in terms of diversity. Regarding beta diversity, all categories differed amongst themselves (dissimilarity 80%), which may be related to the presence of exclusive species in each category, requiring specific habitat characteristics, due to specific reproductive modes.

Accordingly, parks have become “islands,” or habitat fragments, for amphibians in highly urbanized areas. Understanding the habitat use pattern of amphibians in fragmented urban environments is essential for biodiversity conservation in urban ecosystems. Several environmental features may affect anuran communities in urban parks, including the characteristics of fragmentation, landscape heterogeneity, breeding habitat, and human disturbance. In particular, it is unclear whether a larger habitat area could lead to higher anuran species richness (species-area relationship) in urban parks. The aim of this study was to examine whether the species-area relationship is relevant for anurans in urban parks, and to determine the environmental characteristics that likely influence anuran communities. We used a visual encounter method to survey anuran communities (species richness and abundance) in 16 parks located in highly urbanized areas of Shanghai, China. Fragmentation characteristics included fragment size and shape index. Landscape heterogeneity was measured as compositional heterogeneity (using the Shannon diversity index of wetland types) and configurational heterogeneity (using edge density of different land use types). We found that compositional and configurational heterogeneity had significant positive effects on anuran species richness and relative abundance, respectively, in the urban parks. We also found that high edge density along streams benefited anuran abundance. However, there was no significant relationship between fragment size and anuran communities, and the abundances of Pelophylax plancyi and P. nigromaculata were negatively associated with the edge density of large ponds and roads. Our results suggest the importance of landscape structure in urban parks for sustaining anuran persistence. In addition, diverse breeding habitats and landscape heterogeneity should be considered positive indicators of anuran biodiversity conservation in fragmented urban habitats. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Cited By :10 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Changes in population parameters can provide early warning signs of negative impacts. In tropical forests, where habitat loss and fragmentation are vast, such indicators are of high relevance for directing conservation efforts before effects are irreversible. Most of our knowledge from tropical ecosystems originates from community level surveys, whereas our understanding of the influence of habitat conversion on vital rates of species is limited. This study focused on the influence of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on the survival probability and abundance of three leaf-litter frog species (Rhinella ornata, Ischnocnema guentheri and I. parva) in forest patches of the Atlantic rainforest of South-east Brazil compared to a continuous forest. The species differ in their matrix tolerance: high for R. ornata and low for I. guentheri and I. parva and, thus, we examined whether their survival and abundance correspond to this classification. Ischnocnema guentheri showed highest abundances in all study sites and low mortality in the forest patches compared to the continuous forest; I. parva was encountered only in isolated fragments, with very low mortality in one isolated fragment; and the matrix tolerant species had generally low abundance and showed no clear pattern in terms of mortality in the different sites. Our counter-intuitive results show that even matrix sensitive amphibian species may show high abundance and low mortality in small forest patches. Therefore, these patches can be of high value for amphibian conservation regardless of their degree of matrix aversion. Landscape level conservation planning should not abandon small habitat patches, especially in highly fragmented tropical environments.

Habitat suitability of a threatened species can vary temporally due to environmental changes. However, vegetation growth is rarely considered prior to mitigation attempts. The Green and Golden Bell Frog (Litoria aurea) is threatened by habitat loss and has been the subject of several habitat offsetting projects. Despite following recommended habitat templates, nearly all management projects have failed in creating a self-sustaining population. In this study, we examined differences in L. aurea occupancy among ponds with varied levels of vegetation density. We investigated extant occupancy patterns during a 2-y period among areas of sparse, medium, and dense vegetation growths. We also conducted a field manipulation experiment to determine differences in abundance and biotic and abiotic factors between waterbodies with either sparse (manually removed) or dense (naturally overgrown) vegetation covers. Occupancy by adult females and juveniles, but not adult males, differed among sites with different vegetation densities. Female occupancy was greater at sites with medium vegetation densities; whereas, juveniles occupied medium and densely vegetated waterbodies more frequently than sparsely vegetated waterbodies. We also detected differences in potential predators, aquatic competitors, food resources, and water quality between the sparsely and densely vegetated waterbodies. Our data should allow for better habitat management of future L. aurea compensatory projects, and underscores the importance of using both quantitative and qualitative pre-analysis to question temporal variances in habitat suitability prior to management offsets. © 2018.

Edge effects can have serious impacts on species diversity and community dynamics. To assess the effect of oil palm plantation edges on anuran communities in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, we surveyed anuran species and measured structural habitat and landscape parameters at 74 sites spread across forest and plantation habitats along the Kinabatangan River. We then evaluated how anuran species richness and assemblage composition varied in relation to these environmental parameters. Relative species richness was higher at forest sites, compared to oil palm plantation sites. Plantation sites were dominated by wide-ranging terrestrial species, and assemblage composition varied mostly in relation to standing surface water. Forest habitats supported both more endemic and arboreal species. Variability on anuran assemblage composition in forest habitats was greatest in relation to distance to forest edge followed by canopy density, which was also partially correlated with forest edge distance. Moreover, anuran species richness in forest habitats declined as proximity to the forest-plantation interface increased, and as canopy density decreased. Our study provides further evidence that oil palm plantations provide little conservation benefit to anurans. Furthermore, oil palm plantations appear to have adverse pervasive impacts on amphibian diversity considerable distances into adjacent forest areas. These findings suggest that in order for small patches or narrow corridors of retained forest in landscapes managed for oil palm to maintain biodiversity values in the long term, their sizes and widths need to adequately account for the considerable influence of edge effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :6 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Lowland areas in tropical East and Southeast Asia have a long history of conversion from forestland to agricultural land, with many remaining forests being chronically degraded by wood cutting, livestock grazing, and burning. Wetlandbreeding amphibians that have evolved in lowland forests in the region have adjusted to changes in habitat composition caused by humans' activities, and populations continue to persist. However, we have little understanding of the impacts of forest disturbance on these species beyond assessments of abundance and distribution, and species considered to be common and widespread have been largely neglected. Methods. We examined body condition and sex ratios of toads (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), predation risk in treefrogs (2 Polypedates spp.), and growth and survival of leaf litter frogs (2 Microhyla spp.) in agricultural land, degraded forest, and intact forest in two study areas, Thailand and Hong Kong. Results. Toad populations exhibited higher body condition and female-biased sex ratios in intact forest. Predation of treefrog embryos by flies was lower in intact and degraded forests than in agricultural land. Embryonic survival and larval growth and survival in leaf litter frogs were lower in intact forests than in agricultural land. Results for each study were similar between study areas. Discussion. For three of five of these common amphibian species, we documented signals of forest loss and disturbance in their populations. Although these species occur in disturbed habitats, loss of forest cover continues to degrade aspects of their population demography. We urge conservation biologists to consider that populations of species appearing to be common, widespread, and tolerant of human disturbance may be eroding over time. © 2018 Karraker et al.","Cited By :3 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Woodland amphibians require connected aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their life cycle, and often rely on metapopulation structure for long-term persistence. Wetland loss and deforestation fragment amphibian populations, which may result in population isolation and its negative effects. The aim of this research was to analyze the population genetic structure of small-mouthed salamanders (Ambystoma texanum) in western Ohio, where agriculture is now the dominant land use. Salamander tail tissue was collected from eight breeding pools. Three pools occur in the same forest; the other five are in forest patches at distances ranging from 250 m to 20 km from one another. Eight microsatellite loci were amplified by PCR and genotyped for allele size. Observed heterozygosities were lower than expected in all sampled populations; the two most isolated sites (Ha1, Ha2) had the highest inbreeding coefficients. Ha2 also had the lowest mean number of alleles and was found to be genetically differentiated from populations to which our data analysis indicates it was historically connected by gene flow. The most distant site (Ha1) had the highest number of private alleles and showed genetic differentiation from other populations both historically and currently. Geographic distance between pools was strongly correlated with the number of private alleles in a population. The results suggest that population isolation results in decreased genetic diversity and that a breakdown of metapopulation structure due to landscape change may contribute to differentiation between once-connected populations. © 2017 The Authors.

Using pitfall traps, we captured frogs leaving ponds and radio-tracked 30 individuals to characterize overland movements. We checked traps and located frogs daily for up to eight weeks. We assessed factors related to the number of frogs leaving ponds using linear models and to distances moved by frogs using linear mixed models. The number of frogs caught was related to rainfall, but not water temperature, and more frogs were found outside ponds at an intermediate level of rainfall. Frogs who left ponds moved an average of 97 m/day, but distances were highly variable among individuals. Sex and size did not explain differences in distances moved, after accounting for individual variation. One individual moved 1,658 m in a day and another 9,888 m over 36 days. These distances are farther than recorded previously for this species.

Rice is among the world’s most important food crops, invariably affecting biodiversity worldwide. Although the effects of habitat conversion to rice crops on biodiversity are not completely understood, landscape modification often creates conditions that benefit some species and excludes others. We conducted an integrative evaluation of the effects that habitat conversion to irrigated rice crops has on anuran communities from a Cerrado-Amazon ecotone. We adopted a multidimensional approach to compare anuran communities from agricultural and pristine environments considering (i) taxonomic metrics; (ii) functional and phylogenetic diversity; (iii) selected and excluded traits and (iv) body condition indices. When compared to their pristine counterparts, agricultural waterbodies showed increased functional divergence and decreased species diversity and functional richness. Furthermore, agricultural anuran communities exhibited lower phylogenetic diversity. Nonetheless, taxonomic diversity did not vary significantly, suggesting that it should not be used without complementary metrics. Species with small range, habitat specialization, small clutches and large body size were excluded from rice crops. Furthermore, frogs showed lower body condition in crops than in pristine areas. Understanding how species traits correlate with specific responses to agriculture will allow better predictions of the functional effects of anthropogenic land-use. Maintaining high diversity in anthropogenic environments is important for ecosystem resilience because diverse communities are more likely to hold multiple species capable of contributing to ecological functions.

Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL). Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models. In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas.

The basis of this study is data gathered over two decades of amphibian fencing alongside roads in the Austrian state of Salzburg. Different statistical approaches were used to analyse the data. Overall average increase or decrease of each species was estimated by calculating a simple average locality index. In addition the statistical software TRIM was used to verify these trends as well as to categorize the data based on the geographic location of each migration site. The results show differing overall trends for the two species: the common toad being stable and the common frog showing a substantial decline over the last two decades. Further analyses based on geographic categorization reveal the strongest decrease in the alpine range of the species. Drainage and agricultural intensification are still ongoing problems within alpine areas, not only in Salzburg. Particularly in respect to micro-climate and the availability of spawning places these changes appear to have a greater impact on the habitats of the common frog than the common toad. Therefore we consider habitat destruction to be the main potential reason behind this dramatic decline. We also conclude that the substantial loss of biomass of a widespread species such as the common frog must have a severe, and often overlooked, ecological impact. © 2017 Kyek et al.

As rice is among the world’s most important crops, determining how agricultural communities are shaped is imperative. However, few studies have addressed the factors that alter community assembly in human-modified landscapes. We aim to quantify taxonomic, functional, trait and phylogenetic diversity of an anuran community from rice crops on a biodiversity hotspot. Objectives: Identify local and landscape characteristics responsible for variations in multiple dimensions of anuran diversity in rice crops. Methods: This study was performed in Tocantins, Brazil. We chose 36 lentic waterbodies on rice fields for anuran sampling. We quantified taxonomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) for each waterbody. We also estimated the mean functional differences among species for each trait separately. To evaluate how local and landscape scale features affect anurans, we performed generalized linear mixed models in 500, 1000 and 1500 m buffers around each waterbody. Results: We found increased PD and FD in waterbodies closer to many other waterbodies and large forest patches. Anuran biomass decreased with increasing distance to the closest waterbody. Trait diversity varied with waterbody abundance and closeness, percentage of bare ground and marginal vegetation. Conclusions: Our study emphasizes the importance of waterbody and forest patch networks for maintaining high anuran FD and PD in agricultural landscapes.

The large-scale replacement of natural habitats with human-modified habitats, such as the replacement of forests with agricultural and livestock farming areas, creates a scenario where natural habitat patches are immersed in an inhospitable land use matrix. We sought to evaluate how forest fragments (FFs) are influenced by the different surrounding landscape components, where we assessed how agricultural matrices that differ in structure and seasonality affect the structure of FFs and their amphibian assemblages. Location: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Methods: Using diverse methods including satellite imagery, historical land use and field data, we evaluated the effects of representative agricultural matrices on the structure of FFs and their amphibian composition, species richness and abundance. Results: Our results suggest that the structure of FFs and amphibian composition, species richness and individual abundance are intimately linked to the type of matrix and its proportion around FFs. The nature of the matrix is more likely to affect species richness, individual abundance and composition of amphibian assemblages than FF size, reducing the species-area relationship in FFs. There is strong support for the hypothesis that certain agricultural matrices facilitate FF exposure to the elements and a decrease in forest integrity within the fragment, which is reflected in a loss of strict forest inhabitants. Those matrices that allow for a greater exposure of FFs also appear to favour their occupation by habitat generalists. Main conclusions: Surrounding matrices affect the structure and dynamics of forest remnants and should therefore be considered in management plans of severely fragmented landscapes. The influence of the land matrix should be urgently assessed, as it has effects on species occurrences and distribution. This is especially relevant considering the increasing deforestation rates in biodiversity hotspots world-wide. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cited By :25 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Amphibians are especially threatened by habitat modification, yet we know little about why some species persist or thrive in the face of this threat whereas others decline. Our aim was to identify intrinsic factors that explain variation among amphibians in their sensitivity to habitat modification (SHM), factors that could help target groups of species for conservation. Location: Global. Time period: 1986–2015. Major taxon studied: Amphibians. Methods: We quantified SHM using species abundances in natural and altered habitats as reported in published field surveys. We first examined associations between local SHM and range-wide threatened status, population trends and invasiveness. We then evaluated the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic variables in explaining species SHM using multiple comparative methods. Our analyses included over 200 species that could be ranked with confidence from 47 studies across five continents. Results: Amphibians species varied considerably in local SHM. High SHM was associated with elevated range-wide extinction risk and declining population trends. Species that were tolerant of habitat modification were most likely to be invasive outside their native range. Geographical range size was the most important intrinsic predictor and was negatively associated with SHM. Larval habitat was also an important predictor, but was tightly coupled with phylogenetic position. Main conclusions: Narrowly distributed species whose larvae develop on land or in lotic habitats are most sensitive to habitat modification. However, other unmeasured, phylogenetically constrained traits could underlie the effect of larval habitat. Species range size is frequently correlated with global extinction risk in vertebrates, and our analysis extends this macroecological pattern to the sensitivity of amphibians to local habitat loss, a proximate driver of extinction. These general patterns of SHM should help identify those groups of amphibians most at risk in an era of rapid habitat loss and scarce conservation resources. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cited By :45 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

An important factor in determining the ability of species to cope with such changes is their potential to sustain a populations network by dispersal across the landscape. Habitat quality and structure are particularly important for surface-dwelling species with low dispersal abilities, such as amphibians. To assess this ecological function, ponds in a coastal and typically rural area of northern France were surveyed for amphibians in 1974, 1992 and 2011. These repeated surveys yielded different outcomes for different species groups. Three rare species persisted in more or less specialized habitat types. Two moderately common species declined, but kept strongholds in coastal dunes and associated marshes. Five common species with broad ecological niches remained equally widespread. The Northern crested newt declined markedly and the Midwife toad declined dramatically, as did their breeding habitats in vegetated ponds and cattle drinking troughs. One species, the Moor frog, may have gone locally extinct. A model of relative resistance to amphibian dispersal was created for different landscape types, on a scale from 0 (low resistance) to 1 (high resistance). This generated values of 0.23 for pasture, 0.72 for arable and 0.98 for urban and transport. As pasture declined in the study area, while arable and urban/transport infrastructure increased, amphibian dispersal became more difficult. However, dispersal paths proved difficult to evaluate in a patchy landscape like the one surveyed, due to a paucity of spatial signal. Pond loss is a more tractable reason for the observed amphibian species decline than is the quality of intervening terrestrial habitat matrix. In 2011, 22 newly created ponds had species richness in line with pre-existing ponds and this will have counteracted a dwindling metapopulation structure, indicating that habitat creation/restoration can play a valuable role in conservation. The colonization of new ponds may also prove more informative for gauging the potential for amphibian dispersal in the landscape than the preceding decline. © 2017, The Author(s).","Cited By :63 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

To be able to consider ecosystem functioning in conservation actions, analyzing the effects of habitat alteration on functional diversity is essential. Some altered habitats can maintain a significant part of regional biodiversity, however, functional diversity information in altered habitats is so far mostly lacking. We compared functional richness and functional β-diversity based on resource-use traits of frogs between three land-use categories in a rainforest ecosystem in Madagascar. Land-use categories represent a habitat alteration gradient ranging from continuous forest over forest fragments to matrix habitats including different agricultures. Our study revealed distinct changes in resource-use trait composition and complex patterns in the relationship between species richness and functional richness. Thus, the functional structure of frog assemblages changed due to habitat alterations. However, altered habitats likely provide different, rather than fewer functions compared to intact forest. Streams in all land-use categories were the functionally richest habitats, and thus important for ecosystem functioning. Species richness was one, but not the only driver of functional richness in our system. Functional clustering, potentially due to environmental filters depending on resource availability, was caused by anthropogenic and natural drivers. Our study shows that, even in systems where fragmented landscapes still maintain high species diversity, functional diversity can be altered in human altered habitats, which may affect ecosystem processes like productivity, nutrient cycling, and energy flows. © 2017 The Authors","Cited By :28 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We used a citizen science database of anuran surveys to examine the relationship between road density, land use and the distribution of frogs and toads across spatial scales and regions of the United States. Location: Eastern and Central United States. Methods: We compiled data on anuran occupancy collected from 1999 to 2013 across 13 states in the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program, a citizen science survey of calling frogs. These data were indexed to measures of land use within buffers ranging from 300 m to 10 km. Results: The negative effects of road density and development on anuran richness were strongest at the smallest scales (300–1000 m), and this pattern was consistent across regions. In contrast, the relationships of anuran richness to agriculture and forest cover were similar across local scales but varied among regions. Richness had a negative relationship with agriculture/forest loss in the Midwest but a positive relationship with agriculture in the Northeast. Anuran richness was more closely related to primary/secondary road density than to rural road density, and the negative effects of larger roads increased at smaller scales. Individual species differed in the scales over which roads and development affected their distributions, but these differences were not closely related to either body size or movement ability. Main conclusions: This study further refines our understanding of the relationship between roads and amphibian populations and highlights the need for research into the specific mechanisms by which roads affect amphibians. Additionally, we find that relationships between land use and species richness can differ substantially across regions, demonstrating that one should use caution in generalizing from one region to another, even when species composition is similar. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cited By :16 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

The intensification of agriculture, habitat loss, fragmentation of populations and toxic substances in the environment are considered as driving factors for this decline. Today, about 50% of the area of Germany is used for agriculture and is inhabited by a diverse variety of 20 amphibian species. Of these, 19 are exhibiting declining populations. Due to the protection status of native amphibian species, it is important to evaluate the effect of land use and associated stressors (such as road mortality and pesticide toxicity) on the genetic population structure of amphibians in agricultural landscapes. We investigated the effects of viniculture on the genetic differentiation of European common frog (Rana temporaria) populations in Southern Palatinate (Germany). We analyzed microsatellite data of ten loci from ten breeding pond populations located within viniculture landscape and in the adjacent forest block and compared these results with a previously developed landscape permeability model. We tested for significant correlation of genetic population differentiation and landscape elements, including land use as well as roads and their associated traffic intensity, to explain the genetic structure in the study area. Genetic differentiation among forest populations was significantly lower (median pairwise FST =0.0041 at 5.39 km to 0.0159 at 9.40 km distance) than between viniculture populations (median pairwise FST =0.0215 at 2.34 km to 0.0987 at 2.39 km distance). Our analyses rejected isolation by distance based on roads and associated traffic intensity as the sole explanation of the genetic differentiation and suggest that the viniculture landscape has to be considered as a limiting barrier for R. temporaria migration, partially confirming the isolation of breeding ponds predicted by the landscape permeability model. Therefore, arable land may act as a sink habitat, inhibiting genetic exchange and causing genetic differentiation of pond populations in agricultural areas. In viniculture, pesticides could be a driving factor for the observed genetic impoverishment, since pesticides are more frequently applied than any other management measure and can be highly toxic for terrestrial life stages of amphibians. © 2017 Lenhardt et al.","Cited By :16 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana temporaria",,

The construction and use of roads is among the most common sources of habitat fragmentation and can lead to serious population declines. Unused resource access roads, such as those formerly used for logging, can still negatively impact salamanders and reduce habitat quality through edge effects. Unfortunately, habitat rehabilitation and enhancement is rarely attempted on unused forest roads. Aims Our aim was to elaborate on a previous study that tested several types of woody debris to mitigate the negative impacts of forest roads by creating a novel habitat on an unused forest road in Algonquin Provincial Park. Here we focus solely on the use of large, squared timbers and their use by salamanders. Methods We tested the application of coarse woody debris (CWD) to the surface of an unused forest road. CWD were sampled for salamanders seven times during the 2011 field season. Local climatic variables were tested against salamander captures, and CWD size preferences and patterns of salamander aggregation under CWD were assessed. Key results We observed five salamander species and 415 individuals under timbers in the 2011 field season. Larger timbers (>1m3) were preferred by all species observed and a significant proportion of animals were found in groups of two or more under larger timbers. High ambient temperature and low relative humidity negatively affected the number and species composition observed under timbers, suggesting that the efficiency of CWD as a survey method and enhanced habitat is season dependent. Implications Large timbers placed on unused forest roads may provide suitable refuges for migrating or dispersing forest salamanders while they attempt to cross the road. The tendency of salamanders to aggregate under CWD allows individual red efts to reduce water loss; however, red-backed salamanders are territorial and may drive off conspecifics. The use of large CWD may be an effective and low-cost method to rehabilitate unused forest roads and can be used to promote habitat connectivity for salamanders in targeted habitats, such as near wetlands, or for other species of concern. © 2017 CSIRO.","Cited By :2 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Logging | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

In many tropical regions, the matrix habitat area (habitat between fragments of remaining natural habitat) considerably exceeds the area of the original habitat. Therefore, understanding the factors determining matrix quality for animals is a key step to guide conservation action in fragmented landscapes. Matrix habitat, although being often highly disturbed, might provide valuable habitat for some species, serves as buffer zone for remaining natural habitat or corridor between fragments, and hence could be an important component for biodiversity maintenance on a landscape scale. We evaluated the effects of matrix quality on frog diversity in a rainforest ecosystem in Eastern Madagascar. Although frog diversity was affected in all matrix habitats, we found that variation in matrix quality was an important factor. Matrix habitat could serve as valuable habitat and corridor (i.e., high frog diversity along streams in the matrix), as buffer zone (moderate diversity in banana plantations), or was unsuitable habitat for most frog species (very impoverished diversity in secondary vegetation and rice fields). The remaining natural vegetation in and outside protected areas in Madagascar and worldwide is decreasing and will not be sufficient to preserve its biodiversity on a long term. Therefore, we must understand responses of organisms to disturbance in order to create buffer zones and corridors combining both disturbed and natural habitats.

Among the multiple factors involved in their decline, habitat loss and alteration as a result of human activities is a major threat. At the individual level the effects of habitat alteration are potentially multiple, including a range of morphological and physiological responses. Analysing and understanding these responses is therefore a critical challenge for amphibian conservation. We examined the influence of intensive vehicle traffic (motorbikes and trucks on unpaved pathways) on the body size and condition and on the production of glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone) in the yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that intensive vehicle traffic has a negative influence on body size and body condition, and postulated that it also increases corticosterone production. Using morphometric data and saliva samples collected from four populations in France, we found that intensive vehicle traffic is associated with a decrease in body size and body condition in both males and females. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that corticosterone production was lower in both sexes in populations experiencing intensive vehicle traffic. We suggest that measures should be applied to reduce vehicle traffic intensity on unpaved pathways during toad breeding activity.

Argentina is undergoing an agriculturalization process with rapid changes in landscape structure. Objectives: We evaluated anuran response to landscape composition and configuration in two landscapes of east-central Argentina with different degrees of agriculturalization. We identified sensitive species and evaluated landscape influence on communities and individual species at two spatial scales. Methods: We compared anuran richness, frequency of occurrence, and activity between landscapes using call surveys data from 120 sampling points from 2007 to 2009. We evaluated anuran responses to landscape structure variables estimated within 250 and 500-m radius buffers using canonical correspondence analysis and multimodel inference from a set of candidate models. Results: Anuran richness was lower in the landscape with greater level of agriculturalization with reduced amount of forest cover and stream length. This pattern was driven by the lower occurrence and calling activity of seven out of the sixteen recorded species. Four species responded positively to the amount of forest cover and stream habitat. Three species responded positively to forest cohesion and negatively to rural housing. Two responded negatively to crop area and diversity of cover classes. Conclusions: Anurans within agricultural landscapes of east-central Argentina are responding to landscape structure. Responses varied depending on species and study scale.

Resource limitation in altered environments can potentially affect trophic ecology of amphibians and contribute to decline. In this work, we analyzed changes in resource availability and use, and the population abundance of eight amphibian species from six wetlands that differ in type and degree of human disturbance. Food resource availability varied among sites and the occurrence of some arthropods was correlated with type of disturbance regime. Diet evenness, richness, and niche breadth were similar among sites or months. Nevertheless, diet composition showed significant variation among samples for all species. Diet composition changes among populations were correlated with resource availability in four species (Lysapsus limellum, Dendropsophus nanus, Hypsiboas pulchellus and H. punctatus), but not in the remaining species (D. sanborni, H. raniceps, Scinax nasicus and S. squalirostris). These results suggest that species that are able to adjust their diets according to prey availability may have an adaptive advantage in changing environments associated with anthropogenic disturbances.

Roads impact amphibian species through barrier effects and traffic mortality. The landscape variable ‘accessible habitat’ considers the combined effects of habitat loss and roads on populations. Objectives: The aim was to test whether accessible habitat was a better predictor of amphibian species richness than separate measures of road effects and habitat loss. I assessed how accessible habitat and local habitat variables determine species richness and community composition. Methods: Frog and tadpole surveys were conducted at 52 wetlands in a peri-urban area of eastern Australia. Accessible habitat was delineated using a highway. Regressions were used to examine relationships between species richness and eleven landscape and local habitat variables. Redundancy analysis was used to examine relationships between community composition and accessible habitat and local habitat variables. Results: Best-ranked models of species richness included both landscape and local habitat variables. There were positive relationships between species richness and accessible habitat and distance to the highway, and uncertain relationships with proportion cover of native vegetation and road density. There were negative relationships between species richness and concreted wetlands and wetland electrical conductivity. Four species were positively associated with accessible habitat, whereas all species were negatively associated with wetland type. Conclusions: Barrier effects caused by the highway and habitat loss have negatively affected the amphibian community. Local habitat variables had strong relationships with species richness and community composition, highlighting the importance of both availability and quality of habitat for amphibian conservation near major roads. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cited By :9 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

The restoration of degraded habitats is therefore vital. Successful habitat restoration, however, requires proper identification of critical habitat characteristics and recognition of the factors that threaten the species. In this study, we describe the geographic variation of habitat characteristics for a widely distributed species with a declining population trend in Europe, the Common Spadefoot Toad (Pelobates fuscus). We examined 407 water bodies and their surrounding habitats in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Estonia by measuring 23 habitat characteristics and evaluating their effects on the species using canonical discriminant, logistic regression, and Spearman correlation analysis. We demonstrate that while the habitat features related to the selection of a breeding site by the species (based on presence/absence of larvae) were generally similar among the countries, habitat characteristics related to the quality of the breeding site (represented by larval abundance) varied considerably. In the Netherlands larval abundance correlated negatively with the area of uncultivated land and positively with the presence of organic crop fields near the breeding site. In Estonia, larval abundance was negatively related to deciduous forests in the surroundings of the reproduction site, and in Denmark it was mainly influenced by aquatic habitat qualities. Such differences could derive from the geographic variation of the habitat requirements of the species, but they could also indicate geographic differences in threatening factors present in each country. In the Netherlands and in Denmark, intensive agriculture seems to be the most important threat to the species, whereas in Estonia the overgrowing of open habitats (e.g., meadows, extensively used fields) and small freshwater bodies have severely affected the species. © 2015.

However, there is a debate over whether habitat change impacts geographic species distribution. We assess how habitat loss restricts large-scale species distribution on a geographic scale for four South American anurans that are known to occur in well conserved habitats, yet which are absent in others that are close by and more degraded. We used occurrence records of each species in Brazil and performed different modeling algorithms to compare ensemble distribution models generated by two different sets of predictors: a climate-only versus a climate-habitat procedure. We found that the distribution area predicted by the climate-only procedure was larger than that of the climate-habitat procedure for all species. The areas not predicted by the climate-habitat but predicted by the climate-only procedure for all species are commonly located in inland areas in southeastern Brazil, which coincides with areas that have suffered the most from habitat loss in the country. Plotting the predictions against well-surveyed areas where the species have not been recorded, we found evidence that habitat loss may have restricted the current geographic ranges of Hypsiboas faber and Rhinella ornata. Finally, modeling approaches incorporating habitat landscape metrics, particularly for habitat-specialist species, may be a helpful tool for identifying areas that harbored these species before deforestation took place. © 2016, The Ecological Society of Japan.","Cited By :6 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Amphibians in particular are susceptible to agricultural practices that threaten both their wetland and upland habitats. Although local site variables are important for determining species occurrence, site occupancy is also mediated by the broader landscape and management context in which the site occurs. Objectives: Investigate the relative effects of broad-, intermediate-, and local-scale factors on species occurrence for pond-breeding anurans within different landscapes across an agricultural-disturbance gradient in the Cerrado. Methods: Ponds were surveyed for adult anurans over 3 years within 18 landscapes (each 625 km2) that varied in their degree of agricultural land use (landscape context). We analyzed species distribution models for eight pond-breeding anurans, using hierarchical binomial generalized linear models. Results: The broader landscape context had a significant effect on the incidence of pond-breeding anurans, even after accounting for variation in other environmental factors at more local (pond) or intermediate (1-km2) scales. The top-ranked models for most species included some combination of broad-, intermediate- and local-scale factors, however. These covariates influenced species occurrence in different ways, with the response to agricultural disturbance varying among species. Although some species were negatively affected, others appeared to benefit from agricultural activities that increased breeding habitat (e.g., impoundments to provide water for cattle).

This loss in habitat diversity and the use of agrochemicals are considered as major causes of the global erosion of biodiversity. Landscape changes may also favour phenotypic variation with divergences between populations even at a small spatial scale. We investigated this notion in the common toad (Bufo bufo), a species that inhabits a wide variety of rural habitats. Specifically, we compared the morphology of male adult toads from three contrasting landscapes: forests, traditional farming landscape and intensive farmlands. Overall, individuals from open landscapes were larger and heavier, had longer hind legs and larger parotoid glands than their forest counterparts; suggesting that open landscapes positively influence body size in this species. However, toads from intensive farmland were less symmetrical, suggesting that these individuals may have experienced environmental stress during larval and/or post-metamorphic development. Overall, our results suggest that landscape-specific traits can influence the morphology of male toads in complex ways.

However, no studies have directly investigated changes to biodiversity throughout the oil palm life cycle, in which oil palm matures for 25–30 yr before replanting. This process leads to major changes in the oil palm landscape that likely influence species assemblages and ecosystem function. We compare frog assemblages between mature (21–27-yr old) and recently replanted (1–2-yr old) oil palm in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across eighteen 2.25-ha oil palm plots, we found 719 frogs from 14 species. Frog richness was 31 percent lower in replanted oil palm (nine species) than mature oil palm (13 species). Total frog abundance was 47 percent lower in replanted oil palm, and frog assemblage composition differed significantly between the two ages of oil palm. The majority of frog species were disturbance-tolerant, although we encountered four forest-associated frog species within mature oil palm despite a distance of 28 km between our study sites and the nearest extensive tract of forest. Although it is clear that protection of forest is of paramount importance for the conservation of tropical fauna, our results indicate that management decisions within tropical agricultural landscapes also have a profound impact on biodiversity.

Secondary Forest and Riparian Forest were the vegetation cover type with the highest local diversity, whereas the highest turnover was between the forested and human-altered areas. The species in the assemblage showed specific microhabitat associations with the substrate and the vertical stratification, with lower mean values of niche overlap between species pairs in forested area than in human altered areas.

Because they depend on wetlands for breeding, many conservation studies focus on aquatic habitat degradation and destruction. Additionally, few studies showed that changes in terrestrial habitats could be another threat that may cause the decline of amphibian populations. However, little is known about the terrestrial habitat preferences of most species. Although the proximity of forests and wetlands was expected to be positively related to amphibian presence, while human-modified habitats were expected to be avoided by these species, we still have little information on how these responses are species-specific. Based on an ecological niche factor analysis completed by partial least squares path modelling, we tested whether or not relationships between terrestrial and aquatic habitat parameters and occurrences are congruent across a metacommunity of seven amphibian species co-occurring at the regional spatial scale. We highlight that habitat type could strongly affect amphibian presence at large spatial scales, but in different ways. Agricultural landscapes, semi-natural areas and fragmented-landscape parameters showed expected negative correlations with the presence of some species. However, these habitats were also positively associated to the presence of other species. Indeed, because they could offer some benefits, some species could show a preference for these landscapes.

Across central Appalachia (USA), mountaintop removal mining and valley filling (MTR/VF) is the prevailing form of land-use change and represents a stressor to stream ecosystems. Salamanders are the dominant vertebrate in Appalachian headwater streams. Thus, we addressed the question: Is salamander occupancy and conditional abundance reduced in streams impacted by MTR/VF? We conducted repeated counts of adult and larval salamanders within 10-m reaches in 11 valley-filled streams and 12 reference streams in south-eastern Kentucky. Relationships between occupancy, conditional abundance, and site type (MTR/VF vs. reference) were modelled using the hurdle model (Ecology, 94, 2013 and 1472), where occupancy is modelled separately from abundance while accounting for differences in per-individual detection probabilities among groups. We found mean occupancy probabilities were >0·85 for all groups in reference reaches, whereas mean occupancy probabilities were relatively lower in MTR/VF reaches (ranging from 0·23 to 0·66). Posterior means of the difference in occupancy between site types were negative across all groups, although MTR/VF stream reaches were at least 95% less likely to be occupied by spring salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, adult southern two-lined salamander Eurycea cirrigera and larval dusky salamanders Desmognathus compared to reference reaches. Posterior means of the difference in conditional abundance between MTR/VF and reference stream reaches were negative across all groups; 95% credible interval for difference in conditional abundance covered zero for only one species (red salamander Pseudotriton ruber). After adjusting for goodness-of-fit, point estimates of differences in occupancy and conditional abundance still remained below zero for most species. Additionally, MTR/VF reaches had higher ion concentrations, total organic carbon and specific conductance compared to reference reaches. Synthesis and applications. Our study concludes that mountaintop removal mining and valley filling (MTR/VF) reduces salamander occupancy and conditional abundance. Although the potential mechanisms responsible for reduction are numerous, our findings suggest a change in the current regulatory framework is needed to offset the impacts of MTR/VF on stream ecosystems and biota. Reclamation techniques that enhance conditions for vegetative succession within catchments may improve habitat on reclaimed surface mines.

Brazil is the richest country inspecies of amphibians, and the Brazilian regionswith the greatest amphibian diversity are experiencing relativelyhigh rates of habitat destruction. We tested the use of measurements of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) taken onadult frogs, as well as heterozygosity estimates in frog populations, to detect anthropogenic stress. We hypothesizedthat greater human occupancy in the landscape might result in more stressful conditions for amphibians,which would be reflected in high FA levels and/or reduced heterozygosity. We conducted this study at the Espinhaço mountain range in southeastern Brazil, using an endemic species (Bokermannohyla saxicola, Hylidae)as a model. We found that adult frog FA levels differed among localities but did not find significant correlationsbetween human modification of the landscape and FA levels. In the subsample of localities for which we had geneticdata, heterozygosity was significantly inversely correlated with FA in adult frogs, and heterozygosity decreasedwith increasing human occupancy in the landscape, except for populations with marginal distributionwithin the species range that already had very low heterozygosity. Our major finding was that reduced heterozygositymay be caused by population isolation resulting from human occupancy (among other causes) and iscorrelated with increased fluctuating asymmetry, so that either may indicate higher levels of stress in populationsof B. saxicola. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :18 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Bokermannohyla saxicola",,

Nineteen anuran species, belonging to 11 genera and 5 families, were recorded. Species richness was similar between the forest remnants and the agricultural landscapes (18 and 19 species, respectively). Anuran species composition was associated with habitat type and the number of vegetation types in breeding habitats. Most species preferred breeding habitats in the agricultural landscape. Our results suggest that the anuran species recorded have access to both forest remnants and agricultural landscapes, as species richness in the two areas was similar. Habitat type and the number of vegetation types may influence species composition, because vegetation provides shelter and calling sites for anurans, which breed mainly in lentic water bodies.

Only very few studies assessed the effect of fragmentation on morphological traits. The few available studies on anurans found that in landscapes with less forest cover body size decreased. Therefore, we predict that body size should also be smaller in fragments compared to continuous forest. Body condition is a further trait closely related to individual performance and thus should decline with more adverse conditions, as is expected in fragments. We tested these hypotheses using snout-vent length, body mass, body condition, and tibia length as response variables. We collected data of a habitat generalist (Rhinella ornata) and a habitat specialist (Ischnocnema guentheri), both leaf-litter amphibian species, from three sites in a fragmented landscape (two isolated and one connected site) and one site in a contiguous part of the Atlantic Forest of Southeast Brazil. In the generalist species, snout-vent-length (SVL) and body mass were significantly lower in fragments compared to the contiguous forest control, whereas tibia length and body condition did not differ among sites. In contrast, SVL, body mass, and tibia length of the specialist species did not differ among sites, but body condition was marginally different among sites, being relatively low in one but not the other isolated fragment. The results indicate that different processes affect the morphology of the two species following habitat fragmentation. © Copyright Henning Steinicke et al.

Timber harvesting in the United States has caused dramatic changes in quality and extent of forest ecosystems, and intensive forest management still occurs. Although numerous studies have documented substantial reductions in amphibian densities related to timber harvest, subsequent extinctions are rare. To better understand the population dynamics that have allowed so many amphibian species to persist in the face of widespread forest disturbance, we developed spatially explicit metapopulation models for four forest-dependent amphibian species (Lithobates sylvaticus, Ambystoma opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. maculatum) that incorporated demographic and habitat selection data derived from experiments conducted as part of the Land Use Effects on Amphibian Populations Project (LEAP). We projected local and landscape-scale population persistence under 108 different forestry practice scenarios, varying treatment (partial cut, clear-cut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, and clearcut with CWD retained), cut patch size (1, 10, or 50 ha), total area cut (10, 20, or 30%), and initial amphibian population size (5, 50, or 500 adult females per local breeding population). Under these scenarios, landscape-scale extinction was highly unlikely, occurring in,1% of model runs and for only 2 of the 4 species, because landscape-scale populations were able to persist via dispersal even despite frequent local extinctions. Yet for all species, population sizes were reduced to;50% in all clear-cut scenarios, regardless of the size of harvested patches. These findings suggest that debate over timber harvesting on pool-breeding amphibian populations in the United States should focus not on questions of landscape-scale extinction but on the ecological consequences of dramatic reductions in amphibian biomass, including changes in trophic interactions, nutrient cycling, and energy transfer. Additionally, we conclude that amphibian declines and extinctions are far more likely to occur as a result of permanent habitat loss resulting from development than from the temporary degradation of habitat caused by current forestry practices. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Cited By :14 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Logging,Anura & Caudata | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ambystoma opacum,Ambystoma maculatum,Ambystoma talpoideum,Lithobates sylvaticus",,

Wetlands are especially susceptible to invasive plants, both native and exotic, but the effects of such invasions on animal assemblages remain poorly understood. Here, we present information on the impact of selected environmental variables, especially coverage by the native shrub Combretum laxumJacq., on the structure of an anuran assemblage in the Pantanal, a huge flood-pulsed South American wetland. Anurans were surveyed during the rainy season in 17 plots, which differed in extent of C.laxum coverage, leaf litter volume, soil moisture and distance to permanently wet areas. Effects of these environmental variables on the species number, relative abundance and composition of the anuran assemblage were evaluated using multivariate statistical analyses. We captured 1203 anurans, of 21 species from four families. Both the number of species and the relative abundance of anurans were lower in plots with greater C.laxum coverage, which also influenced anuran species composition. Number of species was highest in plots located closest to permanently wet areas, which provide protection from desiccation and other resources during the Pantanal dry season, and so could be considered source areas of anurans. While many anuran species were negatively affected by the homogenization of the landscape caused by shrub encroachment, some seemed to be favoured in such circumstances. For these, dense shrub encroachment into natural grasslands may provide safer migratory routes to permanently wet habitats. Thus, at the mesoscale, a mosaic of areas with different levels of coverage by C.laxum (shrub islands) may aid anuran assemblages in the Pantanal wetlands, facilitating the maintenance of higher beta and gamma diversity. © 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.","Cited By :15 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

The extinction of the last natural populations of the yellow-bellied toad in Belgium, Luxembourg and several regions of southern and western France suggests a widespread decline. By using site-occupancy models and adding covariates corresponding to the human-influenced features of the landscape, we tried to identify the relative effects of different land-use types on the species’ distribution pattern in a man-made environment (the Alsatian Rhine floodplain in France). We recorded presence–absence data in 150 forest sample plots (300 × 300 m) and then modeled species distribution while taking into account detection errors in the field. Land-use was recorded on two spatial scales: within the forest sample plots and in a 1500 m radius buffer area around the forest plots. In the forest plots, toad occurrence was negatively correlated with loss of forest cover to agricultural land. In contrast, occurrence is positively correlated with the density of human-made rutted dirt paths and tracks, which provide semi-natural breeding sites. In the 1500 m radius buffer zones around forest plots, toad occurrence was negatively correlated with the density of urbanization and road networks.

Most of the endemic terrestrial salamander species in the region are classified as 'globally secure' by the IUCN, primarily because much of their ranges include state- and federally protected lands, which have been presumed to be free from habitat loss. However, the proposed and ongoing development of the Marcellus gas resources may result in significant range restrictions for these and other terrestrial forest salamanders. To begin to address the gaps in our knowledge of the direct impacts of shale gas development, we developed occurrence models for five species of terrestrial plethodontid salamanders found largely within the Marcellus shale play. We predicted future Marcellus shale development under several scenarios. Under scenarios of 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000 new gas wells, we predict 4%, 8%, and 20% forest loss, respectively, within the play. Predictions of habitat loss vary among species, but in general, Plethodon electromorphus and Plethodon wehrlei are predicted to lose the greatest proportion of forested habitat within their ranges if future Marcellus development is based on characteristics of the shale play. If development is based on current well locations, Plethodon richmondi is predicted to lose the greatest proportion of habitat.

Undergraduates from nine biology and environmental science courses collated occupancy data and characterized landscape structure at 1617 sampling locations from the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program.

In contrast, developed land around wetlands had small, or even positive effects on anuran species richness and distributions after controlling for road effects. Effects of upland habitat composition varied among species, and habitat split had only weak effects on species richness or individual species distributions. Mechanisms underlying road effects on amphibians involve direct mortality, behavioral barriers to movement, and reduction in the quality of roadside habitats.

Salamanders comprise a significant amount of forest community biomass, and given their sensitivity to environmental stressors, including those caused by timber harvest, they often serve as important indicators of declines in forest ecosystem function. Several studies have focused on the impacts of timber harvest on salamanders inhabiting perennial and intermittent streams, the findings of which have helped inform best management practices for timber harvest in the U.S. Ephemeral headwater streams and associated riparia account for a small fraction of the total landscape, yet these features are critical to the functioning of forested ecosystems; however, few studies have examined how timber harvest impacts salamanders in or near these areas. Our objective was to investigate the effects of three different silvicultural treatments, each involving different streamside management zone (SMZ) characteristics, on salamander communities in southeastern Kentucky hardwood forest ephemeral streams. Data were collected by regular checks of pitfall traps, coverboards, and transect searches. Using both pre- and post-harvest data, abundance estimates were acquired using binomial mixture models. Declines in some species of terrestrial and stream-breeding salamanders were detected, and were shown to be likely related to characteristics of the corresponding silvicultural treatment. We suggest that application of modest SMZ regulations to ephemeral streams would likely reduce or alleviate salamander declines in these important headwater areas. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :15 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Logging | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

This can be devastating to narrow-range endemics whose distributions overlap or are enveloped by urban development. Jollyville Plateau Salamanders (Eurycea tonkawae) are aquatic neotenes restricted to karst-associated waters in a small, highly urbanized area of central Texas. Eurycea tonkawae was recently listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act due to threats from urbanization, although the published literature on their population status is limited to a single, short-term study. Here, we attempt to remedy this dearth of knowledge by summarizing population survey data from sites that span the breadth of E. tonkawae’s range. We analyzed count data using Bayesian inference and generalized linear models, first to determine trends in abundance at eight sites from 1996–2011. Secondly, we examined differences in salamander density at these and an additional nine sites (n = 17) among urbanized and non-urbanized catchments from 2009–2012. Study sites occurred in catchments that ranged from undeveloped to completely built-out, from no-change in development to > 20% increases in development. Accounting for climatic variation, we found that counts of E. tonkawae declined in areas that had the largest increases in residential development (a metric of urbanization) over a 15-y period. Additionally, densities of E. tonkawae were negatively correlated with residential development across their range. We discuss several possible mechanisms responsible for declines of E. tonkawae and highlight likely causes and potential areas of future research to aid in conservation efforts for this and other central Texas Eurycea salamanders. © 2014.

In this context, anurans are threatened by habitat loss because they depend on the characteristics of both local water bodies and adjacent landscapes. We used a model selection approach to evaluate the influence of local and landscape variables in determining anuran species richness and occurrence in 40 freshwater bodies in a heavily deforested region of semideciduous Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. Our aim was to develop recommendations for conservation of anuran communities in rural areas. Pond hydroperiod and area were the most important variables for explaining anuran species richness and occupancy, with greatest species richness being found in water bodies with intermediate hydroperiod and area. Other important variables that reflected individual species occupancies were the number of vegetation types and pond isolation. In addition, recent studies evidenced that water bodies near forest fragments have higher anuran abundance or diversity. In conclusion, we suggest the maintenance of semi-permanent ponds, isolated from large rivers or reservoirs and near forest fragments, as an effective strategy to conserve anuran fauna in agricultural landscapes of southeastern Brazil. Brazilian government requires the maintenance of forests as legal reserve in each farm, and farmers need to maintain ponds as drinking water for cattle or crop irrigation. For this reason, the guidelines suggested in the present study can be easily adopted, without additional costs to rural productivity. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Cited By :26 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

However, populations have declined globally with most declines linked to habitat change. Wetlands and surrounding terrestrial grasslands form habitat for amphibians in the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Wetland drainage and grassland conversion have destroyed or degraded much amphibian habitat in the PPR. However, conservation grasslands can provide alternate habitat. In the United States, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest program maintaining grasslands on agricultural lands. We used an ecosystem services model (InVEST) parameterized for the PPR to quantify amphibian habitat over a six-year period (2007-2012). We then quantified changes in availability of amphibian habitat under various land-cover scenarios representing incremental losses (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of CRP grasslands from 2012 levels. The area of optimal amphibian habitat in the four PPR ecoregions modeled (i.e., Northern Glaciated Plains, Northwestern Glaciated Plains, Lake Agassiz Plain, Des Moines Lobe) declined by approximately 22%, from 3.8. million. ha in 2007 to 2.9. million. ha in 2012. These losses were driven by the conversion of CRP grasslands to croplands, primarily for corn and soybean production. Our modeling identified an additional 0.8. million. ha (26%) of optimal amphibian habitat that would be lost if remaining CRP lands are returned to crop production. An economic climate favoring commodity production over conservation has resulted in substantial losses of amphibian habitat across the PPR that will likely continue into the future.

The study sites of Ijebu Oru (forests/abandoned farmlands) and Ibapon Oyewole (savanna) had a mean number of species and individuals of 21 and 14, and 236 ± 5 and 108 ± 7.9, respectively. However, at Ijede (swamps/forests), there was 18% reduction (6% in 2008; 12% in 2009) of the initial number of species recorded in 2007 due to shifting agricultural practices. Hylarana albolabris, Aubria subsigillata and Ptychadena aequiplicata were no longer accounted for in 2009 surveys. At Onidundun (derived savanna/forests), there was a 17% reduction of anuran species (Ptychadena mascareniensis, Hyperolius f. burtoni and Arthroleptis sp.) in 2008, but 12% of these species (Hyperolius f. burtoni and Ptychadena mascareniensis) were again seen in 2009 after substantial amount of vegetation growth had occurred. The mean number of species and individuals at the study sites of Ijede and Onidundun were 16.67 ± 1.5 and 16.67 ± 1.5; and 203.67 ± 6.7 and 169.67 ± 8.3, respectively. In general, fewer number of amphibian species were observed during the dry season at the four study sites. Habitat destruction and modification are key causes of habitat loss of anuran species observed in this study. Biomonitoring procedures should be applied regularly to detect changes (increase/decrease) in the diversity and abundance of anuran species within a specified study area of interest over time.","Cited By :1 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

It is possible, however, that artificial habitats provide conditions for a minor proportion of the regional species pool, benefiting just a few widespread generalists. We assessed these alternative views by documenting the decline of temporary ponds in a Mediterranean farmland landscape between 1991 and 2009, and by estimating the occupancy of natural (temporary ponds and streams) and artificial water bodies (farm ponds, irrigation channels and drainage ditches) by amphibians across the breeding season (February-June 2010). We used hierarchical Bayesian dynamic multi-species occupancy modelling to control for differences in detectability across species, sampling occasions and habitat types. Over two decades the farmland landscape lost 56% of its temporary ponds, of which 89.3% were destroyed through agricultural activities such as cultivation, conversion to permanent farm ponds, and drainage. The survival rate of ponds was lowest within an irrigated perimeter, and there was no positive effect of protection by a natural park. Estimated species richness per site was at least twice as high in temporary ponds as in the other habitat types. From the 10 amphibian species recorded, seven had the highest occupancy in temporary ponds, and were absent or occurred rarely in artificial habitats. Only a single generalist species was widespread in farm ponds and irrigation channels. The results suggest that artificial water bodies are unlikely to sustain populations of most amphibian species in Mediterranean intensive farmland. Conservation efforts should be directed at protecting the temporary ponds still remaining within the farmed landscape, and at restoring or creating new temporary ponds where these have been lost during the last decades. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :43 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Modified Waterbodies | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Lack of federal protection for isolated wetlands has resulted in loss of amphibian breeding habitat without subsequent mitigation. Additionally, wetlands built for mitigation often do not replicate lost natural wetlands in structure or ecological processes. The long-term role of constructed wetlands for amphibian conservation is poorly understood because monitoring is often lacking. Our objective was to compare amphibian communities of natural wetlands to 2 types of constructed wetlands in the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky. We measured habitat variables including canopy closure, hydrology, upland coarse woody debris, aquatic vegetation, maximum water depth, and Ohio Wetland Rapid Assessment Score at each wetland and quantified species-specific amphibian capture per unit effort using dip-netting. Wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and marbled salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) were almost exclusively found in natural, ephemeral wetlands, whereas large frogs (L. clamitans, L. catesbeianus, L. palustris) were primarily found breeding in permanent, constructed wetlands. Permutational analysis of variance indicated significant differences in amphibian communities between constructed and natural wetland types. Redundancy analysis indicated that hydrology and canopy closure best explained the differences in community composition between natural and constructed wetlands. Regression analyses and subsequent model ranking showed that greater captures per unit effort for eastern newts (Notopthalmus viridescens) and green frogs (L. clamitans) were predicted by increasing wetland size and depth, respectively, whereas mole salamanders (Ambystoma sp.) were negatively associated with the amount of aquatic vegetation and positively associated with wetland depth. As amphibian conservation and management become increasingly important in light of recent population declines and habitat loss, the ability to construct wetlands that provide amphibian habitat and to monitor how amphibians respond will be crucial to preservation of species diversity. Our research underscores the need for monitoring constructed wetlands to assess ecological condition. We provide suggestions to land managers who aim to construct isolated wetlands for amphibians. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Cited By :37 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura & Caudata,Modified Waterbodies | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Aims We evaluate the effect of three land use-type variables and nine landscape matrix quality factors on amphibian presence in four coffee agro-ecosystems and two cloud-forest fragments in central Veracruz, Mexico. Methods Each site was thoroughly searched using the visual-encounter survey technique along different trails in the most feasible microhabitats for detecting amphibians during four rainy seasons (2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009). Centred on the location where each amphibian species was first recorded, we established what we refer to as a buffer area within a radius of 1.5km. A Co-Inertia mathematical model was used to determine which of the explanatory variables contributed to maintaining amphibian diversity. The landscape variables were landscape-quality index, open areas, canopy cover (low, intermediate, dense) at the matrix level, river, road and human population density and site size. Local variables were elevation, plant-structure and biological-impact indices. Key results During the study we recorded 1078 amphibians belonging to 26 species, 17 genera and 10 families. The variables explaining the composition of amphibian diversity were river and human population density, low canopy cover at the matrix level, elevation, site size and plant-structure index. Amphibian diversity increased as the structural complexity of the habitat increased, and the former was positively correlated with fragment size. Conclusion The present study indicated that coffee agro-ecosystems and the cloud-forest fragments in the region form a gradient in habitat quality and landscape variables that exert a differential influence on amphibian assemblages, and that each species responds uniquely to different variables. Implications Coffee agro-ecosystems and forest fragments cannot be seen as homogenous patches with a certain habitat quality, separate from the landscape matrix in which they are immersed. Stakeholders are not advised to rely on a single strategy to conserve the amphibian community, but rather should aim to maintain a heterogeneous landscape with forest fragments and coffee agro-ecosystems that have a complex vertical plant structure at the habitat level, especially in highly river-dense landscapes. © CSIRO 2013.","Cited By :13 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We studied anuran diversity and reproduction of assemblages from 3 sites with different degrees of agricultural activities (an agroecosystem, a transitional area, and a natural forest) located in Entre Ríos province (Argentina). We conducted several field surveys during 2 soybeancropping periods from November 2006 to April 2008. A total of 23 anuran species were identified. Richness, evenness and diversity differed among sites. No range-abundance models were statistically adequate to describe the distribution of abundances within the agroecosystem, whereas the anuran species from the other 2 sites fitted the normal logarithmic model. The location and substrates used for nuptial calling in ponds, as well as the reproductive periods of anuran species varied among sites. These findings might respond to a combination of factors, such as anuran composition, species abundances, availability of reproductive microhabitats, and variation of microclimatic characteristics among sites, the agroecosystem being the most different anuran reproductive community. Finally, our results suggest that agricultural land use have adverse effects on the reproduction of anurans in central-eastern Argentina.","Cited By :14 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Intensive farming occurs in the Southern High Plains, USA, causing habitat loss through cultivation and subsequent sedimentation of playa wetlands. We determined the effects of sedimentation and other factors (e.g., hydroperiod, vegetative cover, wetland volume loss due to sediment, and playa density) hypothesized to have an influence on amphibian species richness.We sampled amphibian species richness in 40 playas with cropland watersheds and 40 playas with native grassland watersheds. Hydroperiod was the primary factor influencing amphibian species richness; playas with longer hydroperiods had higher cumulative amphibian species richness than playas with shorter hydroperiods. Percent vegetative cover was also positively related to species richness. Sedimentation of playas in the Southern High Plains reduces hydroperiod length and the number of playas available to breeding amphibians, two factors influencing richness. Shortened hydroperiods negatively affect reproductive success of amphibian species with long larval periods [e.g., barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium), American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana)], limiting amphibian species richness.

The expansion of pine in the Coastal Plain of Southern Brazil is out of control and its impacts on aquatic biodiversity are little known. We tested the following hypotheses: the pine occurrence diminishes the anuran richness and abundance in ponds and it changes the anuran composition; the beta-diversity between pine and native grassland matrix ponds (natural ponds) is determined mainly by nestedness. Sampling was carried out from 2007 to 2009 in five ponds in pine invasion matrix and five ponds in native grassland matrix. The natural ponds showed a greater richness of tadpoles (10 species) than pine ponds (5 species). The mean richness of adults was higher in natural ponds than pine ponds throughout the entire study. The species composition was different between natural and pine ponds, for both adults and tadpoles. Comparing natural ponds with each other and the pine ponds with each other, our results showed that neither nestedness nor turnover was determinant for beta-diversity. However, when natural ponds were compared with pine ones, we found that the contribution of nestedness was higher for the anurans beta-diversity than turnover. Increases in the nestedness mechanism indicated that the pine occurrence results in species loss in Southern Brazil ponds.

Whilst the underlying theory has been discredited, the categorization remains of interest, because species with 'fast' life history traits are thought to be more robust to human-induced environmental change than those with 'slow' life history traits. We examined the life history traits of the endangered Australian frog Litoria raniformis, to determine whether it displays 'fast' life history traits (like its sister species L. aurea and L. castanea), and to assess the role of these traits in the decline of this species. Mark-recapture data confirmed that L. raniformis displays rapid growth and maturation. The data also suggest that L. raniformis displays relatively low adult survival rates. We propose that the 'fast' life history traits of this species are adaptive to metapopulation dynamics. In turn, we suggest that the rapid decline of L. raniformis may have resulted from metapopulation collapse, driven ultimately by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and proximately by severe stochastic perturbations. © 2011 The Authors.

Habitat loss is the greatest threat to amphibians and the importance of the spatial configuration of terrestrial and breeding habitats upon the landscape in determining amphibian persistence is poorly known. The information gap is particularly acute in tropical landscapes that simultaneously host the greatest and most imperiled amphibian fauna on Earth. We installed 125 artificial ponds at different distances from forest fragments embedded in an agricultural matrix in southeastern Brazil. Constructed ponds attracted 13 anuran species; ponds at the forest fragment-matrix transition hosted a greater abundance and higher species richness of frogs and toads than those installed either far from or well within forest fragments. Forest fragments larger than 70 ha in agricultural areas harbored more individuals than smaller fragments.

Critical to the process of habitat loss is the organismal response, which can have effects on immediate conservation measures or future restoration. Among the most threatened and underappreciated habitats are headwater streams, which are small but abundant features of montane forests. These habitats comprise a significant proportion of the total stream length, can harbor remarkable biodiversity, and are critical for numerous ecosystem processes. One of the most abundant organisms in montane headwater ecosystems are salamanders, and therefore what happens to salamanders when the forest habitats surrounding headwater streams are altered? Three main hypotheses exist: (1) mortality hypothesis; (2) retreat hypothesis; and (3) evacuation hypothesis. To examine these hypotheses we evaluated the impacts of even-aged riparian timber harvest on stream-breeding salamanders. Riparian forests along headwater streams were logged, leaving riparian buffers of 0. m, 9. m, and 30. m. Responses to each riparian alteration were measured in terms of salamander terrestrial habitat use and growth in the riparian habitat, as well as changes in population density within headwater streams. Adult and juvenile salamander densities measured in headwater streams were significantly greater in logged riparian treatments than in unaltered riparian treatments. In addition, salamanders significantly reduced their terrestrial habitat use following riparian logging with both the average distance from the stream and the relative abundance of salamanders decreasing. It is unlikely that salamanders will persist in highly modified riparian habitats, as we measured significantly reduced body conditions over short periods of time at these sites. We present corroborative evidence that salamanders evacuate the riparian habitat following intensive riparian logging, emigrating to adjacent headwater streams. Our results underscore the sensitivity of stream salamanders to riparian habitat alteration as well as the importance of riparian buffers in preserving amphibian assemblages. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :29 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Logging | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

Two areas were sampled - one dominated by open pastures (four populations) and the other by sugar cane plantations (two populations) - in an attempt to evaluate the possible influence of the type of anthropogenic matrix on genetic variability and gene flow (dispersion). The populations presented a relatively uniform genetic stock, with low levels of inbreeding (Fis) and high levels of admixture between localities (Fst, Rst, STRUCTURE) indicating no genetic subdivision. The results indicated relatively high levels of recent migration among sites (m) and no isolation by distance. The analyses also found that historical and contemporary rates of migration among populations were broadly similar.

Ponds and other small stagnant water bodies are crucial for maintaining regional biodiversity, yet they are vulnerable to human induced landscape change. We investigated for 199 ponds in the 'département' Pas-de-Calais in north-western France if pond persistence (n= 86, 43%) or disappearance (n= 113, 57%) was related to wider changes in the landscape, over the period 1975-2006. Landscape data were obtained from aerial photographs (1963), two ASTER satellite images (2001 and 2003) and observations on the ground (1975 and 2006) and land use around the ponds was described over concentric circles with five different radii in the 100-1000. m range. Overall, pond disappearance was associated with a decrease in grassland and an increase in arable fields around the ponds. We found that the small, man-made cattle ponds, with either natural substrate or concrete drinking troughs, were more often affected than the larger, semi-natural ponds. Since the cattle ponds are regularly used for amphibian reproduction, their massive abandonment therewith weakens the population network and puts the local occurrence of some of the rarer species at risk.

As a consequence, lower landscape connectivity is expected to enhance extinction risks through a decrease in gene flow and the resulting negative effects of genetic drift, accumulation of deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression. Such phenomena are particularly harmful for amphibian species, characterized by disjunct breeding habitats. The dispersal behaviour of amphibians being poorly understood, it is crucial to develop new tools, allowing us to determine the influence of landscape connectivity on the persistence of populations. In this study, we developed a new landscape genetics approach that aims at identifying land-uses affecting genetic differentiation, without a priori assumptions about associated ecological costs. We surveyed genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci for 19 Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) populations in western Switzerland. Using strips of varying widths that define a dispersal corridor between pairs of populations, we were able to identify land-uses that act as dispersal barriers (i.e. urban areas) and corridors (i.e. forests). Our results suggest that habitat destruction and landscape fragmentation might in the near future affect common species such as M. alpestris. In addition, by identifying relevant landscape variables influencing population structure without unrealistic assumptions about dispersal, our method offers a simple and flexible tool of investigation as an alternative to least-cost models and other approaches. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cited By :49 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mesotriton alpestris",,

We investigated to what extent geographic distance and barriers affect the genetic composition of the crested newt, Triturus cristatus in Flanders (North Belgium), causing inbreeding or loss of genetic diversity. Data from seven microsatellite loci and 170 individuals from seven metapopulations up to 180km apart revealed heterozygosities of 0.53 to 0.67 within populations and moderate levels of genetic divergence between populations (F ST values from 0.074 to 0.141, harmonic means of D est between 0.070 and 0.189). In all Flemish meta-populations, more than 90% of the individuals from a given geographic region were assigned to the same genetic cluster indicating little genetic exchange, even in De Panne where the two populations Oosthoek and Westhoek are only a few kilometres apart. Such sub-structuring on a micro-scale has also been described in other amphibians. Unique alleles in most populations further support the probability that genetic drift has already led to some isolation. With the exception of the Oosthoek population, however, we found no significant evidence for bottlenecks. Connectivity within pool clusters seems essential to the maintenance of genetic diversity in crested newts as is indicated by our findings from Tommelen, the population with the largest number of pools in close proximity, which also shows the highest levels of heterozygosity (H e and H o) and the second highest number and richness of alleles. In conclusion, our study indicates that dispersal and migration rates between the Flemish populations of Triturus cristatus are limited at the geographic scale studied here but that habitat fragmentation has not yet led to a significant loss of genetic diversity of the studied Flemish populations, possibly because crested newts are relatively long-lived, fragmentation of their habitat is relatively recent in Flanders, and most investigated pools are still connected at the local scale.","Cited By :8 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Caudata,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Triturus cristatus",,

The effects of these changes in habitat conditions on the persistence of populations are expected to differ among species depending on their dispersal habits: species with strong site fidelity would likely be more affected by habitat loss and degradation, whereas species with highly dispersive habits would be more threatened by habitat fragmentation and split (the dispersal-dependent-decline hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution patterns of two paddy-associated frog species (Pelophylax nigromaculatus and Hyla japonica) with different dispersal habits along a rural-urban gradient of the Osaka-Kobe metropolitan area, Japan. Our results partially support the dispersal-dependent-decline hypothesis in that the species with strong site fidelity, i.e., P. nigromaculatus, was threatened by habitat-area (agricultural field) decline and habitat-quality degradation (prevalence of concrete levees) rather than by habitat fragmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first report that suggests paddy-associated amphibian declines via urbanization in the Asian region. However, the second half of the hypothesis, i.e., that the dispersive species (H. japonica) would be more strongly affected by habitat fragmentation via roads and habitat split via declines in surrounding forests was not supported. The lack of support for this portion of the hypothesis may be due to the high adaptability of H. japonica to artificial landscapes.

Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species. Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements. © 2011.","Cited By :40 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

However, few studies have dealt with animal populations living in cities. In this paper, we assessed the genetic structure of urban red-backed salamander populations located in remnant forested areas within a major city (Montréal) and on two nearby islands. Microsatellite analysis revealed a high degree of genetic differentiation among populations from Montréal and from neighboring islands. Within Montréal island, no clear genetic structure was detected, with some populations as far as 35. km apart not being differentiated. On the other hand, genetic differentiation was observed at a small spatial scale (0.7-1.7. km) for three populations located near downtown area where anthropogenic perturbations are older. We believe these populations had very low effective population size for a long time, allowing for fast genetic drift and subsequent population differentiation. Although no inbreeding was detected in any population, genetic variation was relatively low.

A stomach content analysis was conducted on Pelophylax perezi, an endemic anuran heavily colonizing rice fields in Monegros, an arid region in northeast Spain. The taxonomic range of prey consumed by this species was compared with prey availability and dietary changes were evaluated among frog size groups. Small adult insects (dipterans, coleopterans, ants and heteropterans) were the main diet, indicating an active foraging mode. Frogs showed no preference for any prey taxa. Larger frogs consumed a higher volume of food, but relatively fewer prey than smaller individuals. A large niche breadth was recorded for all groups. Food partitioning was lowest between distant size groups. Maximum prey size was significantly related to morphological constraints such as frog size and mouth width. Bigger frogs preyed on larger items while also foraging on smaller ones, indicating no prey size selection. Overall, P. perezi had a generalist feeding pattern dictated mainly by prey availability. These food habits may help the species to persist in the agricultural landscape of this arid region.","Cited By :4 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Pelophylax perezi",,

Pool-breeding amphibians have complex life cycles that place them at risk from habitat loss and fragmentation both in wetlands and in adjacent uplands. Because the most rapidly growing cause of habitat degradation in North America has been urbanization, a threat analysis of pool-breeding amphibian habitat should both be dynamic, i.e., sensitive to land-use change, and comprehensive, recognizing traditional protected area networks as well as less formal conservation assets (e.g., land-use regulations). To assess threats to wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in a rapidly urbanizing, forested region of New England (USA) we examined gaps in the current protection network, as well as changing human settlement patterns. We found that greater than 50% of 542 potential breeding pools delineated using low-level infra-red aerial photography (median area 379.5 m2) were not represented on National Wetland Inventory (U.S.FWS) maps, and thus de facto at risk. Most importantly, conservation lands and regulatory protections failed to protect 46% of potential breeding pools and 80% of adjacent non-breeding habitat.

Habitat loss is a leading cause of global amphibian declines. Forest removal is a particularly significant threat because an estimated 82% of amphibians rely on forests for part of their lives. 2. Biphasic amphibians rely on suitable terrestrial habitat to support their post-metamorphic growth and survival and also to maintain appropriate habitat and landscape connectivity. 3. We created 4 replicate, 16-ha experimental arrays in the southeastern USA to examine the effects of forest removal on migratory movements of adult biphasic amphibians. Each array contained four forest-harvesting treatments that included an unharvested control, a partially harvested stand, a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained, and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed. 4. Some amphibian species emigrated from wetlands in significantly greater numbers through forest controls compared with harvested treatments. Also, salamanders were generally more sensitive to forest removal than were frogs, with a significantly greater proportion of salamanders migrating through forested habitat compared to frogs. 5. For several species, individuals were significantly more likely to avoid clearcuts when emigrating compared to immigrating. Individuals that emigrated into clearcut treatments were more likely to reverse direction and return to wetlands in some species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies one mechanism by which forest removal shapes the abundance and distribution of amphibians in terrestrial habitat. To promote the persistence of amphibian populations, conservation efforts should focus on preserving forest habitat adjacent to reproduction sites. Such measures are especially important where forest habitat connects local populations or where it links reproduction sites to other habitat features necessary for amphibian growth, survival, or overwintering. © 2008 British Ecological Society.","Cited By :74 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Deforestation,Anura & Caudata | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We sampled 24 wetlands monthly for tadpoles using throw-traps and dipnets during the 1999 wet season (June-October), recording 10,126 tadpoles of 10 species.

The most heavily modified habitat (pasture) had both species-poor assemblages and low tadpole abundances. Species richness in woodland, rangeland, and native prairie wetlands were similar, but woodland wetlands had higher tadpole abundances. Wetlands in the four habitats differed in the amount of nearby woodland and wetland habitats, length of hydroperiod, and percent cover of aquatic vegetation, which likely contributed to the observed amphibian richness and abundance patterns.

To efficiently manage and conserve this species and its genetic diversity, knowledge of the genetic structure is crucial. Based on nine polymorphic microsatellite loci, the genetic diversity, genetic structure and gene flow were investigated at 12 sites representing 5-10% of the natterjack toad localities presently known in Denmark. The expected heterozygosity (H E) within each locality was generally low (range: 0.18-0.43). Further analyses failed to significantly correlate genetic diversity with population size, degree of isolation and increasing northern latitude, indicating a more complex combination of factors in determining the present genetic profile. Genetic differentiation was high (overall θ = 0.29) and analyses based on a Bayesian clustering method revealed that the dataset constituted 11 genetic clusters, defining nearly all sampling sites as distinct populations. Contemporary gene flow among populations was undetectable in nearly all cases, and the failure to detect a pattern of isolation by distance within major regions supported this apparent lack of a gene flow continuum. Indications of a genetic bottleneck were found in three populations. The analyses suggest that the remaining Bufo calamita populations in Denmark are genetically isolated, and represent independent units in a highly fragmented gene pool.

In the first study of its kind, we measured the extent and type of relationship underlying the road-effect zones of a motorway with a high proportion of heavy-truck traffic, particularly at night (Highway 401) for anuran species richness and relative abundance. We surveyed 34 ponds located 68-3262 m from the edge of the motorway, and used piecewise and linear regressions to determine if road-effect zones were clearly delineated by ecological thresholds. We found road-effect zones of 250-1000 m delineated by ecological thresholds for four of seven species and species richness, and road-effect zones of well beyond 1000 m best described by linear regressions for two species. The negative effect of Highway 401 was unexpectedly strong for four of seven species suggest that, in addition to road mortality, very high nighttime truck traffic can actually lead to reduced use of breeding habitat near the motorway either by acting as a barrier to forest habitat on the other side of the highway and/or because of traffic noise. Our results show that most anurans are likely to have reduced abundances near motorways, but that both the extent of the effect of this type of road and the underlying relationship vary considerably between species. Furthermore, the noise and/or barrier effect of very high nighttime traffic volumes can lead to negative effects of motorways even on species that are relatively unaffected by direct road mortality. © 2009 by the author(s).","Cited By :122 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

A key component of studying population response to habitat alteration is to understand how fragmentation affects population connectivity in disturbed landscapes. We used landscape genetic analyses to determine how habitat fragmentation due to timber harvest affects genetic population connectivity of the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), a forest-dwelling, stream-breeding amphibian. We compared rates of gene flow across old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest, although this was likely a historical signature of continuous forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations. Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity. © 2008 The Authors.","Cited By :89 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Ascaphus truei",,

Using two different survey methods (area-constrained daytime searches and night-time visual encounter searches), we estimated terrestrial habitat use and abundance for stream-breeding salamanders in three different tree stand age-classes in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2005. We found that overall stream salamander abundance and terrestrial habitat use was reduced in stands < 40 years of age compared with stands 41-80 years old, and > 81 years old. The decreased abundance and terrestrial habitat use was accompanied by a decrease in leaf litter depth, soil moisture and canopy cover.

Current federal wetland regulations in the United States do not protect isolated wetlands or extend protection to surrounding terrestrial habitat. Consequently, some land managers, city planners, and policy makers at the state and local levels are making an effort to protect these wetland and neighboring upland habitats. Balancing human land-use and habitat conservation is challenging, and well-informed land-use policy is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the specific risks of varying amounts of habitat loss. Using projections of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations, we related the amount of high-quality terrestrial habitat surrounding isolated wetlands to the decline and risk of extinction of local amphibian populations. These simulations showed that current state-level wetland regulations protecting 30 m or less of surrounding terrestrial habitat are inadequate to support viable populations of pool-breeding amphibians. We also found that species with different life-history strategies responded differently to the loss and degradation of terrestrial habitat. The wood frog, with a short life span and high fecundity, was most sensitive to habitat loss and isolation, whereas the longer-lived spotted salamander with lower fecundity was most sensitive to habitat degradation that lowered adult survival rates. Our model results demonstrate that a high probability of local amphibian population persistence requires sufficient terrestrial habitat, the maintenance of habitat quality, and connectivity among local populations. Our results emphasize the essential role of adequate terrestrial habitat to the maintenance of wetland biodiversity and ecosystem function and offer a means of quantifying the risks associated with terrestrial habitat loss and degradation. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Cited By :120 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Fragmentation,Anura & Caudata | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana sylvatica,Ambystoma maculatum",,

Understanding topological perspectives of species' distribution patterns can provide useful information for linking conservation studies at larger scales. We studied topological properties of localities in Alabama where 60 species of 12 families of amphibians were present. Analysis included a clustering coefficient which measures the strength of a population group, the relationship between occurrence localities and species number, the fractal dimension of occurrence localities (which emphasizes spatial irregularity), and distance to nearest-neighbor. The results indicate that the clustering coefficients of most amphibian species were low, but were higher for species with few occurrence localities, such as Rana sylvatica and Limnaoedus ocularis. The general relationship between species number and occurrence localities was that the majority of species held few localities in their distribution, while the remaining species occupied a greater number of localities. The fractal dimension (FD) for all amphibian localities was about 1.58, although FD was low for most individual species. We identified four relationships in the distribution of distance to nearest-neighbor: linear, logarithmic, power and polynomial. These topological properties may indicate intrinsic features about amphibians in Alabama and provide useful information for regional planning. Enhancing landscape linkages across a large area using undisturbed areas, such as 300-500 km in diameter may be a good approach to conservation practice in this region.

We x-rayed frogs collected at 9 sites that differed in the amount of forest cover and measured their snout-vent, radio-ulna, femur, and tibio-fibula lengths. E. antillensis and E. coqui were smaller in the highly disturbed (≤20% forest cover) than in the intermediately (20-70% forest cover) and little-disturbed (≥70% forest cover) landscapes. In E. antillensis but not in E. coqui, the slope and intercept of the curves relating snout-vent length with the length of the 3 bones differed with degree of forest cover, suggesting an effect of habitat loss on body shape. In E. antillensis and E. coqui, differences between right and left sides corresponded to true fluctuating asymmetry; however, only the radio-ulna length of E. coqui showed a trend toward an increase in fluctuating asymmetry with habitat loss.

Using area-constrained daytime searches, we investigated microhabitat use and abundance for stream-breeding salamanders in mature forests in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2004. We found that leaf litter depth, soil moisture, and canopy cover were all higher and soil temperature was lower in plots where stream salamanders were encountered compared to plots where salamanders were not encountered. A regression analysis using the information-theoretic approach (AIC) revealed that the model that included distance from stream, leaf litter depth, soil moisture, and soil temperature had the strongest support for predicting stream salamander abundance at the landscape level (ωi = 0.99). Microhabitat use in many species of stream salamanders is mediated by a number of complex factors including environmental variables, competition, and predation. Alteration of habitats likely results in increased competition and predation rates and subsequent local population declines, so it is imperative to mitigate the effects of practices such as even-aged timber harvesting in order to conserve amphibian biodiversity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The negative association between species richness and traffic density was stronger (partial R2 = 0.34; P &lt; .001) than the positive association of species richness with forest cover (partial R2 = 0.10; P &gt; .05) in the landscape. Three of six common species showed stronger associations with traffic density than with forest cover - Bufo americanus, Rana pipiens, and Hyla versicolor; two species - Pseudacris crucifer and Rana sylvatica - showed stronger associations with forest cover than with traffic; while Rana clamitans showed similar associations with traffic and forest cover. Our results show that the overall negative effect of traffic on anuran populations in northeastern North America is at least as great as the negative effect of deforestation, and also that the relative effects of these two predictors on anuran abundance vary between species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide a global assessment of land use dynamics in the context of amphibian distributions. We accomplished this by compiling global maps of amphibian species richness and recent rates of change in land cover, land use, and human population growth. The amphibian map was developed using a combination of published literature and digital databases. We used an ecoregion framework to help interpret species distributions across environmental, rather than political, boundaries. We mapped rates of land cover and use change with statistics from the World Resources Institute, refined with a global digital dataset on land cover derived from satellite data. Temporal maps of human population were developed from the World Resources Institute database and other published sources. Our resultant map of amphibian species richness illustrates that amphibians are distributed in an uneven pattern around the globe, preferring terrestrial and freshwater habitats in ecoregions that are warm and moist. Spatiotemporal patterns of human population show that, prior to the 20th century, population growth and spread was slower, most extensive in the temperate ecoregions, and largely exclusive of major regions of high amphibian richness. Since the beginning of the 20th century, human population growth has been exponential and has occurred largely in the subtropical and tropical ecoregions favored by amphibians. Population growth has been accompanied by broad-scale changes in land cover and land use, typically in support of agriculture. We merged information on land cover, land use, and human population growth to generate a composite map showing the rates at which humans have been changing the world. When compared with the map of amphibian species richness, we found that many of the regions of the earth supporting the richest assemblages of amphibians are currently undergoing the highest rates of landscape modification. © 2007 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.","Cited By :109 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

We studied the importance of local (study pond) and landscape (current and 18th-century landscape) characteristics in explaining the occurrence and species richness of amphibians (Rana arvalis, Bufo bufo, and Triturus vulgaris) on the Swedish island of Gotland, where more than 40% of wetlands have been lost since the 18th century. Current local habitat characteristics were the strongest determinants of occurrence for all study species. Additionally, species occurrence was related to current and historic landscape characteristics, which generally explained equal amounts of the variation in species-occurrence data. The proportions of both current and historic arable land were negative determinants of amphibian occurrence and species richness, indicating that agricultural land use may have an overall negative impact on amphibians, and that amphibians may occur less frequently in areas with a long agricultural history. Likewise, historic forest area was positively related to B. bufo occurrence and species richness, whereas current forests had no significant effects, suggesting that there may be a lag in the response of amphibians to agriculture-mediated habitat loss.

Most research has assessed the effects of habitat composition at multiple spatial scales on the presence or absence of amphibians at breeding ponds. We were interested in the effects of habitat characteristics on amphibian population size and used Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) and Spotted Salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) egg mass counts as an index. Between 2001 and 2005, we monitored 65 seasonal ponds within forested landscapes in the Pawcatuck River watershed of Rhode Island. Both species were detected in at least 88% of the ponds sampled. Egg mass counts for both species were highest in ponds that usually dried between early October and late November. Wood Frog egg mass numbers were positively associated with pond hydroperiod, size, and depth; location on glacial fluvial deposits; the extent of persistent nonwoody plant cover in ponds; and the area of upland forest within 1 km of the pond edge. Egg mass numbers were negatively associated with location on alluvium or dense till deposits, percent canopy cover, the number of buildings within 1 km, and the area of residential development within 1 km. Spotted Salamander egg mass counts were positively associated with pond hydroperiod, size, and depth, and upland forest area within 1 km. They were negatively related to location on alluvium. Multivariate models developed from within-pond variables explained more variation in egg mass counts for both species than those developed from landscape-level factors, but the best combined models suggested that habitat characteristics at both scales are useful in the prediction of breeding effort at individual sites. Given the continuing urbanization of southern New England and the ineffectiveness of wetland regulations in protecting required terrestrial habitat around seasonal ponds, proactive techniques also are required to assure the maintenance of pond-breeding amphibian populations.

In this context, species that are locally abundant or widely distributed can be informative on how broad scale processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, as those caused by intensive human occupation, affect population genetic structure. In this paper, we analyzed population genetic structure of Physalaemus cuvieri (Amphibia: Leptodactylidae) in the core of the Cerrado biome, in the Goiás State, Central Brazil, using RAPD molecular markers. Local populations are genetically different according to RAPD markers, and an analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) revealed a significant interpopulational variance component around 10%. However, these population differentiation patterns are not strongly structured in geographic space, and a Mantel spatial correlogram indicated only a slight significant spatial structure at short geographic distances. These patterns are expected by the ecological and life-history knowledge of the species, leading to a relatively low magnitude of population differentiation coupled with short distance spatial patterns. Moreover, even these weak patterns showed a signature of effects of human occupation and habitat loss on genetic differentiation at regional scale, with discontinuities to gene flow in two particular regions of the State with more intense habitat loss and older human settlement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Part of its reproductive habitat is crossed by a paved road. We studied the effects of the road on the mortality and mobility of the toads. During the days following rain, we surveyed transects on both sides of the road, capturing, photographing and immediately releasing each toad. Population size in the area was estimated in 1074 individuals (871 to 1363, 95% CI) by means of mark-recapture analysis. We found fifteen individuals killed by vehicles in the 2003-04 and ten in the 2004-05 reproductive seasons. This mortality represents from 2.5 to 5.9% of the population annually, considering that 73% of the mortality period was sampled and a detection rate of dead frogs of 40%. Other factors associated to roadside habitat, such as rapid drying of roadside ditches, maintenance work, increased frequency of fire, pollution by gas, oil and fuel emissions and losses from vehicles, and poaching as pets by tourists, may also reduce the survival of the toads. We recorded capture sites and calculated the average distance between captures as 33.04 m for males and 22.50 m for females. Only two of the 76 observations of recaptured toads were made on the opposite side of the road.

Timber harvesting has been demonstrated to have negative impacts on salamander populations due to changes in soil temperature, soil compaction, and general degradation of habitat. However, little is known about how long it takes for harvested forest habitat to once again become suitable for salamanders. Questions also remain as to whether salamanders will use an area that has been harvested in recent years if an older intact forest area is available. We used drift fences and pitfall traps to capture adult spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and marbled salamanders (A. opacum) migrating to 3 vernal ponds during their breeding seasons. The study area contained tracts of forest that were clear-cut 11-12 years prior to the study. All 3 ponds were surrounded by areas of clear-cut and intact forest and drift fences were placed in both habitat types. Similar numbers of spotted salamanders entered the ponds from clear-cut and intact forest areas. The number of marbled salamanders migrating to the ponds did not differ between areas of clear-cut and intact forest.

We performed six call surveys at 29 permanent focal ponds surrounded by one of three landscape contexts: primarily urban, primarily agricultural, and primarily forested.

We quantitatively related the changes in this habitat type in Estonia to the history of a key inhabitant - the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita Laur.). Between the 1930s and 2000s, 67% of 52 local populations of the toad disappeared; in coastal meadows, the decline was 91%. Since the 1980s, coastal grasslands have lost their value as the main habitat for the species, and occupation of secondary habitats has not balanced the disappearance of primary habitat. According to aerial photographs from 1950-51, 1970-71, and 1996-2000, 60%-83% of the coastal meadow habitats in Estonia were lost by 2000, and the toad became extinct in more than 80% of its historical habitat. The survival of local populations was related to the sizes of managed meadows and sandy areas - larger initial areas were related to better survival, probably due to larger population size. Extinction rates exceeded habitat loss rates during advanced stages of habitat loss after 1970, probably due to the additive effects of habitat fragmentation and the disappearance of critical habitat components. Hence, habitat restoration for natterjack toads should focus on large meadow areas, and should be initiated prior to advance habitat loss. Currently, however, meadow populations of the toad in Estonia are unlikely to persist without artificial re-establishment of populations. © 2007, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Cited By :26 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Bufo calamita",,

The degree of population subdivision was significantly higher among fragmented (FST = 0.238) as compared to non-fragmented populations (FST = 0.022). Furthermore, in the four fragmented populations, significantly lower allelic richness as compared to non-fragmented populations was observed. Together with potential high levels of road mortality leading to smaller population size, these results suggest that separation by highways not only has reduced the genetic diversity and polymorphism in local populations over two decades, but also has resulted in a higher degree of population differentiation, most likely due to genetic drift.","Cited By :63 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Urbanisation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana dalmatina",,

These latter populations inhabit mostly mountain areas and are endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation. At present, no information about genetic variability and gene flow patterns between populations is available and, consequently, it is unknown to what extent geographical fragmentation might have caused restrictions to gene flow. We used six microsatellite loci to characterise genetic variability in R. iberica populations from the Sistema Central. We analysed samples of 142 specimens from 15 populations in this region and another two from additional locations in the Iberian Peninsula. The number of alleles per locus observed ranged from four to 15. Allelic richness, percentage of private alleles and gene diversity was significantly lower in populations from the Sistema Central, where inbreeding coefficients were relatively high. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and estimated FST values indicated the existence of genetic substructuring within this region and suggested the existence of restrictions to gene flow in geographically close populations. Low heterozygosities and a trend towards lower values of genetic variability from western to eastern populations within the Sistema Central suggest that R. iberica has colonised this region recently. We hypothesise that the observed pattern is due to the interaction of both historical (reduced genetic variability in peripheral populations) and present-day (anthropogenic habitat loss) factors that confirm the vulnerable status of populations of R. iberica in central Spain and point to the need for adopting measures directed towards the preservation of existing habitat. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London.","Cited By :18 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana iberica",,

We assessed the potential role of agriculture-related habitat fragmentation on population size and genetic variability in the common frog (Rana temporaria) by recording the occurrence, population density and genetic diversity in three geographically disparate regions in Sweden - each containing landscapes of high and low agricultural activity - and related these to landscape variables extracted from digital maps. We found a highly significant region-by-landscape interaction in occurrence, population density and genetic diversity revealing a reversed response to agriculture from south to north: while the effects of agriculture on R. temporaria populations were negative in the south, there were no effects in the central region, whereas positive effects were observed in the north. Spatial autocorrelation analyses of genetic data revealed that populations in high agricultural activity areas were more isolated than populations in low activity areas both in the southern and central regions of Sweden. Landscape diversity showed a strong positive correlation with both density and occurrence of frogs in Sweden as a whole, as well as in the southern region. Also, negative effects of roads and positive effects of ditches on genetic diversity were found in the south. Overall, these results suggest clear but regionally opposite effects of habitat structure on the population size and genetic diversity of amphibian populations. This means that the management strategy aiming to maximize the size and genetic diversity of local common frog populations, and perhaps also those of other amphibian populations, should account for regional differences in existing land-use patterns. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Cited By :84 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Rana temporaria",,

Recent anthropogenic landscape modifications (drainage, agriculture intensification, larger road networks, and increased traffic) affect species by reducing the suitable habitat area and fragmenting remaining populations. Using a robust concentric approach based on permutation tests, we evaluated the impact of recent landscape changes on the presence of the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea) in wetlands. We analyzed the frequency of 1 traffic and 14 land-use indices at 20 circular ranges (from 100-m up to 2-km radii) around 76 ponds identified in western Switzerland. Urban areas and road surfaces had a strong adverse effect on tree frog presence even at relatively great distances (from 100 m up to 1 km). When traffic measurements were considered instead of road surfaces, the effect increased, suggesting a negative impact due to a vehicle-induced effect. Altogether, our results indicate that urbanization and traffic must be taken into account when pond creation is an option in conservation management plans, as is the case for the European tree frog in western Switzerland. We conclude that our easy-to-use and robust concentric method of analysis can successfully assist managers in identifying potential sites for pond creation, where probability of the presence of tree frogs is maximized.","Cited By :93 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Agriculture | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Hyla arborea",,

The two regions have experienced the same rate of habitat loss but fragmentation has been more severe on Lolland. Genetic variation based on 12 polymorphic DNA microsatellites was analysed in 494 tree frogs sampled from two ponds in Jutland and 10 ponds on Lolland. A significant overall deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations could be attributed to three ponds, all on Lolland. This was most probably caused by an inbreeding effect reducing fitness, which was supported by the observed significant negative correlation between larva survival and mean FIS value and mean individual inbreeding coefficient. A significant reduction in genetic variation (bottleneck) was detected in most of the ponds on Lolland. Population-structure analysis suggested the existence of at least 11 genetically different populations, corresponding to most of the sampled population units. The results indicated that the populations were unique genetic units and could be used to illustrate the migration pattern between newly established ponds arisen either by natural colonization of tree frogs or by artificial introduction. A high degree of pond fidelity in the tree frogs was suggested. A severe fragmentation process reducing population size and fitness within some of the populations probably caused the significant reduction in genetic variation of tree frog populations on Lolland.","Cited By :155 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Hyla arborea",,

The clearing of native forest to plant a monoculture of exotic trees may also reduce and fragment the habitat available for indigenous plants and animals. Metacommunity theory suggests that the species richness of a community in a patch of habitat will increase with patch size but decrease with patch isolation. We investigated whether replacement of native Eucalyptus forest with a plantation of Pinus radiata has reduced and fragmented habitat for frogs, leading to a lower species richness of frog communities in the pine plantation and in small and/or isolated remnant patches of native forest. We surveyed frogs at 60 sites at streams and wetlands in the pine plantation, remnant patches of native forest surrounded by pines, and adjacent areas of contiguous native forest near Tumut in New South Wales, Australia. Only two of eight species of frogs were recorded in the pine plantation, and regression modelling indicated that streams and wetlands in the pines supported fewer frog species than those in remnant patches or the intact native forest. In addition, species richness tended to be higher at wide, shallow swamps and marshes near the headwaters of streams, with herbs, grasses, shrubs, reeds, sedges and rushes in the emergent and fringing vegetation. There was little evidence to suggest that larger eucalypt remnants supported more species of frogs, or that remnants isolated by greater expanses of pines supported fewer species, but we had low power to detect these effects with our data set. Our results support the preservation of all remnants of native forest along drainage lines and around swamps, soaks and bogs, regardless of size. Where new pine plantations are established, for example, on cleared agricultural land, care should be taken to maintain the structural and vegetative characteristics of water bodies to ensure that they continue to provide suitable breeding habitat for frogs. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

Microsatellite allelic richness and the percentage of polymorphic AFLPs were positively correlated with the age of forest stands. Similarly, heterozygosity estimated from both marker types was positively correlated with stand age. Population subdivision (Fst) estimated among forested sites using microsatellite and AFLP markers was 0.033 and 0.095, respectively.

Here, we examine the effects of adjacent land use and water quality on wetland amphibian species richness, abundance, and community composition in 74 Ontario wetlands. Species richness was positively correlated with wetland area, forest cover, and the amount of wetlands on adjacent lands and negatively correlated with road density and nitrogen levels. The land-use effects peak at 2000-3000 m. Amphibian abundance was positively correlated with forest cover, distance to wetlands >20 ha, and amount of marsh habitat and negatively correlated with road density. The effects of adjacent land use were strongest at around 200 m. Land-use and water quality effects varied widely across species, although most species are positively correlated with forest cover and amount of wetlands on adjacent lands and negatively correlated with road density and water quality. These results suggest that the effects of adjacent land use on amphibian communities can extend over comparatively large distances. As such, effective wetland conservation will not be achieved merely through the creation of narrow buffer zones between wetlands and intensive land uses, but rather will require maintaining a heterogeneous regional landscape containing relatively large areas of natural forest and wetlands.","Cited By :202 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Fragmentation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

In the case of the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, in southeastern Australia, detailed notes of early explorers and settlers and early survey maps have provided insight into the nature of these changes. Early explorers described most streams in this area as 'chains-of-ponds'. These are ponds connected by short lengths of channel or divided by grassy intervals. Many of these systems were converted to incised channels after Europeans arrived. An examination of the life history characteristics of frogs and their physiological limitations provides insight into how these changes are likely to have affected frog habitat. Chains-of-ponds provided permanent breeding ponds for frog species with extended larval stages. The environment surrounding these ponds flooded regularly, providing breeding habitat for species that can exploit ephemeral waterbodies. Flood waters and saturated soil also created moist, well-vegetated environments for adult frogs during the non-breeding season. Human impacts and landscape modification led to channel incision of chain-of-pond systems and resulted in many physical changes in pond characteristics, including availability, permanency, structural complexity and flow dynamics. The implications of these changes are discussed in this paper. Hypotheses are developed on frog species susceptibility to landscape change associated with channel incision of chain-of-pond systems.","Cited By :28 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Anura,Modified Waterbodies | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

First, I quantified the effects of peat mining on amphibian species richness and abundance in bog remnants adjacent to mining activity and unmined bogs. I then investigated amphibian occurrence patterns in bog remnants relative to the distance to the mined edge, after accounting for microhabitat and distance to landscape elements. The response of amphibians to peat mining varied across taxa. For instance, amphibian species richness, total amphibian captures (all spp. combined), as well as those of green frogs (Rana clamitans) were greater in unmined bogs than in bog remnants. Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) were most abundant in unmined bogs in areas far from bog ponds, as well as in unmined bogs in areas near shrub patches. After accounting for microhabitat and landscape variables, American toads (Bufo americanus) in bog remnants were most abundant close to mined edges, whereas the other species did not respond to the proximity of mined edges. Peat mining negatively impacts amphibians occurring in bog remnants. The response of amphibians to peat mining is similar to the one of birds and plants, but differs with small mammals.

Forests are cleared and converted to rice fields or plantations (mainly Eucalyptus or pine). How does deforestation affect the amphibian diversity of the original biotope, the rain forest? To answer this question, the amphibian fauna of intact rain forests was compared with that of secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields. The main consequence of rain forest disturbance was loss of amphibian species. Compared with an intact forest, species richness in secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields were 54%, 46% and 12%, respectively. Species number and individual density increased with increasing structural complexity of the habitat and the presence of water bodies. The reproductive strategy of the species could be decisive for the presence or absence of single species in different habitats. With increasing degradation the percentage of species spawning in water increased. Correspondingly, Hyperoliidae and Raninae were characteristic of degraded habitats, whereas Microhylidae and Mantellinae were representative of natural habitats.","Cited By :81 Export Date: 30 June 2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Amphibia,Deforestation | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""z5297814""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Multiple species",,

The amphibian faunas of seven such fragments varying in size from 0.16 to 1250 ha were examined. Twenty-eight amphibian species of two families (Ranidae and Microhylidae) were recorded in the rainforest fragments. The species numbers in the fragments were positively correlated with fragment area and form nested subsets. Composition and individual frequency in small fragments differed from that of the control site (1250 ha). The relative individual density (individuals found each searching hour) was negatively correlated with the fragment size. This is probably due to the fact that the density of streams and brooks was higher in small fragments, which also explains why smaller fragments contained a larger proportion of brook-dwelling amphibian species than larger fragments. Species that live far from water and show a reproduction strategy independent of running waters or ponds, such as certain microhylids, were only present in fragments of 30 ha or more. The more common species in the control site were also found in the majority of fragments. A rainforest remnant of 1250 ha seems to be large enough to contain a large part of the original amphibian fauna, provided that there are suitable microhabitats. Compared to other taxa, amphibians generally seem to react less sensitively to fragmentation.

Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships.
