#write.csv(bib, "data//Neal_scopus_full.csv", row.names = FALSE) #if you want to save this data frame as a csv file
```

```{Load Rayyan data}
screened <- read.csv("SpeciesLab.csv")
names(screened)
dim(screened) 
#183 observations with 19 variables

screened$notes[1]
#contains export info, decisions and labels

#filter rows that do not contain the string 'Included' or 'Maybe' in the notes column
#screened %>% filter(!grepl('Excluded', notes)) %>% filter(!grepl('Maybe', notes)) -> screened_included
#dim(screened_included) #none filtered, already filtered out in export process

#extract record labels from notes column - i.e. string after "RAYYAN-LABELS: "
screened_included$labels <- sub(".*RAYYAN-LABELS: ", "", screened_included$notes)
table(screened_included$labels)

screened_included$labels <- sub(".*RAYYAN-LABELS: ", "", screened_included$notes)

#gsub(".*STR1 (.+) STR2.*", "\\1", a) #g.*jpg>

screened_included$notes2 <- gsub("Cited.*2022 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: \\{\"z5297814\"=>\"Included\"\\} | ", "", screened_included$notes) #remove text between word "Cited" and first inclusion label
screened_included$notes2 <- gsub("ExportDate:30June2022", "", screened_included$notes2) #remove extra field present in a few records
screened_included$notes2 <- gsub("\\|\\|RAYYAN-LABELS:", ",", screened_included$notes2) #remove extra field present in a few records
screened_included$notes2 <- sub(",", "", screened_included$notes2) #remove first comma

#using stringr package functions for further processing:

#see how many labels per record:
max(stringr::str_count(screened_included$notes2, "\\w+"))
hist(stringr::str_count(screened_included$notes2, "\\w+"))

Split the vector into individual labels
#option 1
stringr::str_split(string = screened_included$notes2, pattern = ",") #this splits at "," and creates a list

#option 1
stringr::str_split_fixed(string = screened_included$notes2, pattern = ",", n = 8) #this splits at "," and creates a table (less useful)

Both options require further processing...
